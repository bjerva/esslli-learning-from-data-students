pos,"i have used the camera for three months , and absolutely love it ! the pictures are crisp ( even very close-ups ) , and the video feature is right up there . sound pick-up is excellent . i have created two dvd 's combining videos and still pictures . folks have thought the quality was very good . the battery life was rated very good , and i have found this to be true . i carry the camera with me nearly everywhere i go . people are impressed with the size . drawbacks ? because of its size , there are no connections from the camera to a computer , tv or battery charger . the docking station is small and lightweight . because of the battery life , i have never been away from home long enough to need recharging . i recommend the camera without reservations , and will look first to casio in the future"
pos,"i received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule . i 've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater boston area . you ca n't get a better tripod for the money . in fact , you ca n't get anything "" decent "" for under $40-50 and even then i 'm not sure you will get something this good . i had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office ( which i did n't know ) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 for it . conclusion : is the tripod perfect , no . the head looks a little like plastic . but it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website . this tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer ."
neg,"i bought this product in rite aid . unfortunately , it irriates my face . they are scamming people just to buy this product . instead of repairing my face , this product damage my face . there are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since i start using this . now , i need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product . if i knew this will happen , i will not waste my money to buy this product ."
neg,"this cd is pretty awful , you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd , one of the worst songs ever is calling , , it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground , na na na na , na na na na , i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer....... ."

pos,"nick xu , if you ca n't figure out the difference between this lens , and the cheaper consumer grade lenses , by all means , stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , "" mr magoo "" of cartoon fame could n't tell a chevy from a rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens is simply awesome in use . having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it 's that good . i am using a borrowed version right now , but as soon as i pay off my new 24-105 f / 4 l is usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i will buy my own 70-200 f / 2.8 is usm . it 's as good as it gets in this lens range , but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera , carry on , as it 's all about the end user . for everyone else , this lens is the holy grail of mid range telephoto lenses . it is simply the best available in it 's range , and responds well to canon tele adapters . if you can figure out a way to afford this lens , buy it , as it is all that . if you are a nikon lover buy this lens anyway , and buy a fairly cheap 20d body to make it work . it 's ok to tell your friends that you used a nikon to take the pics , but you will end up knowing that canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all by it 's self in the grand scheme of things . it 's simply awesome . )"

pos,"i have seen phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording . it is a different approach to the classic leroux novel ; one that is gentler and more romantic , but still intense and passionate . the lyrics and music are excellent . even if you are an alw / pto fan , do n't miss this production if it plays nearby ."
neg,"i have been listening to military band music for years , and am rarely disappointed . however , this compendium of music by the u.s. navy , army , and marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste . many of the arrangements are strange , and there is much too much vocal music when what i want to hear is the bands play . i would not have bought this album hhad i known beforehand what i know now"
neg,"the s9000 fits perfectly in the case . too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop . apparently , the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also . too bad the camera strap is extremely short , made for very small people . so , instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well , i will adapt the case to work for me . i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera . i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on . it will work but only after extensive modification . great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before"

pos,"for hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s / early 80s , you ca n't do much better than pat benatar ( and heart ) and this collection carries most - - but not all - - of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years : heart breaker , hit me with your best shot , love is a battlefield , fire and ice , promises in the dark . but no benatar collection is complete without ' treat me right ' , ' you better run ' , and ' i want a lover who wo n't drive me crazy ' ( superior , in my opinion , to the john mellencamp version ) , especially if you prefer benatar 's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads . nevertheless , ' best shots ' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete ' all fired up ' - - the best value for the money ."

neg,"i was super-excited to get this camera , and very disappointed with it once i did . the pictures are blurry far more often than not , even when resting the camera on a table or solid object . additionally , it 's so slow at taking them that any movement ( eyes blinking , etc ) likes like a massive blur . and the video skips all the time . it just misses entire parts . i would highly recommend not getting this camera ."

neg,"i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , "" i ca n't have more ice cream ! "" so , i would suggest renting "" planet of the vampires "" because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was "" lesmo "" , dubbed as the "" european peter lorre "" who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget ."
pos,"if you ca n't get enough of zombie comedies this year , i seriously recommend this one , made in the czech republic of all places ! i saw it at the tribeca film festival ( ny ) and it was tremendous fun . bloody , funny , and smart . an intellectual twist on the "" secluded retreat "" idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives . and of course , they 're overrun by zombies . i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest . it works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral , your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes , the interesting characters , and the joyful way it plays with film conventions . this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic . i was disappointed that it did n't get a theatrical release in the us , so i 'm really glad that it 's coming out on dvd . humor / horror fans will not be disappointed !"
pos,"old spice classic is far and away the best deodorant i 've ever used . it goes on clean , unlike those "" powdery "" white deodorants . it also has a great fragrance and longevity after application . i think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content ; if you look at the ingredients , you 'll see that alcohol is listed first . in fact , the container sports a "" flammable "" warning . the alcohol really does work well to contain odor . alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find , so i 'm thankful this product is still being made"
pos,"a quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running . i 've been able to do most of the things i 've wanted to do with this program and it 's delivered on most of its promises . my wife loves it too . i have to remind myself that i 'm not an architect and this is n't a professional program , though . it does most things really well but it has some short comings . i 'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and have n't had any luck yet . although i 've net seen all tutorials , i 'm doubtful the program can do it at all . foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best . my planned home addition includes a home theater and i 've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls . ( which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator . ) but it has let me put in chairs , speakers , and a projector screen which makes the 3d views very close to what the finished product may look like . the framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose . so as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy . basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and i 've had a blast planning our addition . i ca n't imagine designing our addition / remodel without it . i would buy it again"

neg,"i purchased this humidifier , and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week . one night , it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again . i called the company , who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out , and they would be sending a new one to replace it ( with no cost for shipping to me ) . i received the new one a week later , which to my disappointment , did not have the nightlight feature . i also noticed it was from a different brand company . i ca n't remember the name but it also began with the word "" sun . "" so far , the new humidifier is working fine ( about 2 weeks now ) , but it has a lower water capacity so i have to refill it every night ( vs. every 2 nights with the original one ) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment . the process of replacing , however , was very smooth and also free so i 'll give them 2 stars for that"

neg,"i have owned eleven vcom products and from now on , they do n't have my business . the product touts itself in part as a vital tool when / if your machine crashes . if it does , be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program . you are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you ca n't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you ca n't get through via phone...what you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 is also much slower than version 5. support for 5.0 , by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out , despite the functionality of that program . for the price , the software should work like a major player , rather than a dollar bin special ."
neg,"i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee . the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details , but also historical background . because it 's an autobiography , i do n't necessarily think that it 's fair to damn the book for being self-centered ; it is about him . i do feel , however , that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination . it 's an okay addition to one 's list of books about everest expeditions - which i must admit , i 've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading "" into thin air "" . i would n't , however , use it as my primary source for information or impressions"

pos,"this is one of the great biopic films ever made . more often than not , film biopics are too rushed . they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives , and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives . this is not one of those films . it just covers woody guthrie 's adult life , from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer , and his passionate defense of the working man . the look of the film is deliberate , in that it 's washed out . the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film . they 're really lively , where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves . the film has a real genuine feel to it , like you 're actually watching real people . david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie . he makes you think you 're actually watching woody himself . he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film . ronny cox is excellent as well , and he does his own singing too ( remember , cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance ) . randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well . this is a fabulous film , and it feels short at 2 1 / 2 hours ."
neg,"i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70 's , and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style , i still loved her vocal perfection . this is truly the only album i have n't played more than twice ( i did n't like it the first time , which surprised me , so i tried it again ) . it does n't showcase her voice or her talents . the songs are very ho hum . linda , put out a christmas album ( been waiting for years ) , and try to get sweetness back for this old fan"

pos,"when i first heard this album i was a bit shocked . myself and my fellow tmbg fans derided it as a "" teen angst album , "" moaned and whined that john & john had betrayed us by adding a band , and generally refused to give it a chance . a few years later , listening to my entire collection of tmbg in chonological order ( a sanity-restoration ritual ) , i realized that this album is awesome ! there are only 2 stupid songs , window and dirtbike . hey , for tmbg , that 's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis . aside from that , there are more rockin ' , thought-provoking tunes here than you 'll find almost anywhere . this album establishes beyond a doubt that tmbg are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history . i 'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of tmbg fans who have and will . i will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however : "" i should be allowed to think "" - tmbg does justice to beat poetry , and beyond ! "" why must i be sad ? "" - funny and pissy , great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck . the lyrics are genius , subtly quoting the best of alice cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek . "" a self called nowhere "" - righteous , angry , and breathtaking . angsty punk bands of the world , take note : you will never be this hardcore . "" the end of the tour "" - i have written in my last wishes that i want this one played at my funeral . one of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written . if your idea of tmbg is songs like "" istanbul "" and "" particle man , "" get over it ! and give this album a chance !"
neg,"this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1. the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4. the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "" shiver "" , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim "" konedog "" koenig , astronomy buf"

neg,"i own many sony products , including a sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed by this camera , the sony cybershot dsc-t5. i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present . it is small , lightweight , portable ; easy to use ; and stylish . it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months of use , a few problems have become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there is horrible red-eye ( and white-eye ) artifact in many pictures . the so-called "" red-eye reduction "" setting does nothing .

neg,"for federal returns this is a generally usable product with a very poor user interface and help system , for state returns this product falls below the bar of "" usable "" . i have used the principle competitor , "" tax cut : in the past and have found it to have generally a poor ui , but it was significantly better than turbo tax . some examples of the poor user interface experience are : * if you enter the employer id number from a w-2 in an attempt to retrieve it from the internet and the retrieve fails , then you are asked to re-enter the same id number when you enter the w-2 information manually . * investment sales : i have about 20 stocks i 've sold over the past year , but the window only shows 3 at a time ( with a scrollbar ) . * on the form page , schedule d-1 ( the continuation form for stock sales ) is displayed on the screen with scrollbar if the number of items exceeds the window height , but the scroll bar would not let me scroll to the bottom 2 entries . printing these out does however show them * when entering a stock sale , you can indicate it is worthless to which turbo tax will tell you that it will set the sale date to 12 / 31 , regardless of what you entered in compliance with irs rules . so on my next stock that was worthless i tried to not enter a sale data knowing it would just override it , but the program insisted i enter a sale data , only to then immediately override it . * entering federal information was usually clear enough , but an obvious lack of effort is shown in the state returns ( pa in my case ) . cryptic questions are asked with no explanation and no useful help . for example "" enter adjustment to income , and indicate type of adjustment - - the choice for type include oid , abp , etc. with no explanation of what these are ! . it is not clear whether the amount of the "" adjustment "" should be an absolute or a delta . requesting help brings up a screen on an irrelevant topic ( penalties for early withdrawal of savings ) . * on my state return , it dragged me through 3 screens for every stock sale i made . ( about 20 of them - so 60 screens ) . since it already had the info from the federal return i was doing nothing other than clicking continue over and over . much better would be to present me with a table of all the sales and ask me to check the information there . * it transferred information about my stock sales from my federal to my state return . however i was only a part year resident of the state and it made no attempt to either calculate , or warn me , that many of the sales would not be taxable events in that state because they were sold when i was not a resident of that state . in conclusion , while turbo tax ultimately did help me get the job done , i think i 'll try going back to taxcut next year"

neg,"this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness"

"" colin powell came from jamaican parents ( often called "" jewmaicans "" by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education ) , and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little , if any , racial prejudice . later on , unfortunately , the insults were quite aggravating , but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance . powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny ( majored in geology ) ; however , rotc piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout . powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet , and top graduate ( or very close ) in every military training setting he undertook , as well as a top mba student at george washington university . he also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment , leading to his being offered a white house fellowship , which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs , national security advisor , and secretary of state . one of powell 's "" secrets of success "" was to enthusiastically implement all orders , even those he considered silly - powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others . unfortunately , powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney ( a bit of a problem during gulf war i ; a serious problem when cheney became v.p. ) . between cheney 's far-right bias ( "" out on the looney fringe "" - per powell ) and bush ii 's "" disturbingly disjointed "" decision-making - per treasury secretary o'neill ) , powell 's contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with don rumsfeld 's help . in addition , he was often left out of important decisions , especially when out of the country . ultimately , powell 's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u.n. speech attesting to saddam 's wmd . the big question , still debated , is "" why did n't he resign ? "" his supporters believe the reason is that powell 's nature simply did n't allow anything less than 100% support . bottom line : if cheney had not been such an ideologue ( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v.p. - ignoring powell , and then sliding into the position himself ) , powell would be v.p. today , possibly president in 2008. similarly , if bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in ' 92 , powell might well have become first v.p. , and then president"
neg,"we had this camera for about a year until on thanksgiving day while out of town it broke . the lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera . we ran out to best buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad . ( 2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird . ) at first we liked the camera and it took good pictures . they look great when we got them developed ( costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up , super cheap too ) and the quality was good . within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap . evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems . inside or outside . i am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it . also the flash quality is horrible . it takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it 's of an object ( anything really , just not a person ) it comes out pitch black . inside the lighting is bad too . the camera can never focus and it 's just annoying . i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by sony that for no reason just broke . one of them broke while in a store getting them developed ( in the little machine ) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing . the people said there was no way it was their machine , that it had to be a default in the memory stick . also the camera is pretty big and clunky . at the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market , now it is huge ! i am looking into now buying the canon powershot 6."

pos,i picked up the first volumne of these graphic novel series a while ago and i 've been trying to get the whole series ever since ! the concept is new and interesrting and the art is always great . animal farm was especially good because of all the twists in the plot line . nothing is as it seems to be ! take my word .

pos,"i found the film , "" malice "" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery . sure , there are a lot of twist 's in the film , however , that is what i found to be very good about this film . especially the way these twist 's were done . there will be no spoilers in this review . the film begin 's with murders occuring in a small college town . andy safian ( bill pullman ) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings . all circumstantial . moreover , he is having problems with his wife ( nicole kidman ) . something happens to her , and she blames andy for this . [to tell you would give away the film] it seems as if one of andy 's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon ( alec baldwin ) . therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief , and the doctor ( balwin ) in particular who caused this grief to her . but there is more to the story than meets the eye . there are several stories going on at once . first , you have a serial killer , secondly you have a distraught wife ( kidman ) blaming her ex-husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her . but there is more to her than the viewer suspect's . i will leave this to you to discover . the film is better than the reviews warrant . it is a very suspenseful film full of twists . recommended !"

neg,"so this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar . i 'm fairly well read and , yes , i 've earned a few bucks with my prose . i 'm also a sucker for historic tales , ancient folklore , mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits . ok , i decided , now that it 's in paperback , i 'll give it a read . what i concluded was this : those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown 's work is a literary steaming pile . i read page after page , waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat 's ass about the da vinci code 's protagonists . what a bunch of twits . langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology ( i do n't know if i spelled that right , but i 'm not about to go back in that book and check it ) . apparently , there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon 's books sell better than brown 's , entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status . sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who 's easy on the eyes - - someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he was n't a dipwad like landgon . she 's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough , but she 's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most french probably could n't tolerate it . and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing . from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near ( but , of course ) versaille , this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro . so he 's been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion , opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything . or something like that . oh , i forgot , teabing 's crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him . anyway , this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do - - make lofty , self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world 's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag . the point is that these characters are n't very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it . hell , it 's been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution , yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world . but back to how bad this book is . trite does n't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase . i would give you some examples but , like i said , i 'm not going back in there . one of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor . by now , sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times , been on the run and are exhausted . with a straight face , brown describes how sophie 's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by.. . crumpets . yes , crumpets . hell , teabing , shut up about your conspiracy theories , roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat . offer langdon a stiff drink . i sure needed one at this point . by now i 'm pulling for the albino . then they escape the jaws of death yet again and , naturally , high-tail it to england on teabing 's private jet . i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he 'd left his grey poupon behind . i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino was n't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists . i do n't know how it ends . i do n't care . however , there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery . who knows ? you might like it . this is just my opinion"

pos,"the economy , austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound , and precise filmmakers.. . lang , a master of the german expressionist film , shot his first talkie , a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies.. . it was a shocking idea for its time , based on the real-life killer peter kurten , headlined as the vampire of düsseldorf.. . ' m ' is about a terrorized city , and a plump little man with wide eyes ( often chewing candy ) who is a pathological child-killer , unable to control his urge for killing.. . the film embodies several lang themes : the duality between justice and revenge , mob hysteria , the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in , and , for probably the first time in the cinema , it adds a new dimension to suspense : pity.. . for the killer is clearly mentally sick.. . he cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease , and yet , we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal , rather than treated as a sick man.. . early in the film , the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from ' in the hall of the mountain king' . this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace.. . and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window , the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there , just out of sight.. . the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since ' casablanca , ' ' the maltese falcon , ' and ' the mask of dimitrios . ' when the photographs of his victims , all little girls , are shown to him , he jumps back and twitches with horror.. . with powerful visuals , lang 's motion picture is lorre 's first film.. . his performance as the corpulent , hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion.. . lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes , outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal.. . he had only twelve lines of dialog.. . in the most famous of all about a pathological killer - alfred hitchcock 's ' psycho ' - anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre , but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy.. . ' psycho ' reeked with blood and horror , whereas the suspense of ' m ' is subtle.. . a child 's balloon without an owner , a rolling ball , are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed.. . the audience , trapped in its seats , torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer , watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight.. ."

pos,"every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing , and does it really well . the only question is "" do you need it "" with modern lcd screens and sleep / energy save modes , screen savers are virtually unnecessary . that 's really the point of aquazone , it has no practical value , but it is very cool . before we got our little dog tova , we had a fish tank for a number of years . i do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact . fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer . i think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the sims . you can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank : add and remove fish , feed them , tap on the glass ( or the keyboard in this case ) . even better , you can mix fresh water and salt water , no worries about two male betas in the same tank fortunately you do n't have to clean the tank and you do n't get algae . if you want fish not included in the tank , you can buy some more online if you ( or someone you know ) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous , this is a great program . if you are n't into fish , probably not worth buying pros : does exactly what is says , creates a virtual fish tank cons : probably a productivity waster at the office , gotta love fish to enjoy the program"

pos,"first off , i loved the book cover - spine and all- - one of my all time favorites . it 's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store 's front table . then the title , i loved that just as much . both share the characteristics of being straightforward , to the point , and revealing . both are perfectly simple . i read most the essays and came to think that a . this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi . i constantly begged for my dictionary . it 's probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up : an intellectual snob . i guess he got that from the oprah incident . but i also guess that there 's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career . what 's up with this culture that it 's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon ? the attraction to franzen 's work is that he investigates and reveals - in a binary way : he 's researching facts , he 's listening to feelings ; he 's processing both to give an opinion . the best example of this is my father 's brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father 's brain . there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay ; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss . reading it you sympathize , you empathize and you learn . equally as insightful are : lost in the mail - a look into possible reasons behind chicago 's underperforming mail system the reader in exile - a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city - a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st. louis - a piece that shares the two-sided feelings in a trio of situations ( including the oprah incident ) ."
pos,"i am not a horror movie fan , in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me , but this one indeed made me literally crap myself . i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc 2 years ago , and luckily the movie was just starting , so i got to see it from beginning to end . this movie is basically about a man named frank zito ( joe spinell ) who 's a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women , because he feels he 's getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute . after her death frank feels alone , but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years . frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city , in which he keeps several mannequins . he uses these mannequins by putting his victim 's bloody scalps , on it 's heads . when he spots a woman named anna ( caroline munro ) , a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her , but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her , but kind of a romantic interest . he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts , but will he change his mind about her , and make her become another one of his victims ? some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut-wrenching , especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station , and she hides in a bathroom stall . i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time . the effects were realistic ( nice job tom savini ! ) , they do n't come close to todays , even though the movie was released in 1980. joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real , and not only that , but he physically looked the part too . the scenes where he 's in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie . i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there , because we get to see the results of how an alone , mistreated child might turn out . this is n't one of those lame zombie movies , it 's the real deal . if you like horror , and a lot of gore , and you have n't seen this then i recommend you watching this ."

neg,"the american dream is an appealing myth , no doubt . the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great . the problem , as george carlin put it , is that you have to be asleep to believe in it . so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs . and that is where "" belly "" comes in , an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it . this urban drama stars dmx ( perpetually rapping ) , nas , and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies . the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs . when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha . once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot . one couple tries to escape to africa , but find it easier said than done . and tommy ( dmx ) is sent on a mission to kill a minister . but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that does n't even exist . come on now , i 've known drug dealers in my day , and they did n't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do . rather they live in shacks or their parent 's basement . if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is . the directing by hype williams is n't that bad . he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks . the lighting never seems quite right , but i 'm gonna let that one slide . as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here . there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions . all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it . as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost . any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used . the n and f words are used to comedic proportions . their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason . and then , on top of it all , we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us . sorry man , but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks does n't make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks . you 're still a businessman . this film is not worth watching . any social point that is made is made accidentally , and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta . **1 / 4"

pos,"the oral b eb417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , has a nice gum massage action , and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed . the two heads work twice as good as one , but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head . using it by gently guiding it over your teeth , and letting it do all the work , it will last a long time too . it was nearly three months before i had to replace mine . most oral b brushes are interchangeable with all oral b units . this one though , according to the buying info here , may not be used with the cross action brush . it will also indicate when it 's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles . ( the box shows as good picture of new and used ) . just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too ! it 's a 5 star product , but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out , the better buy would be to purchase the three pack . it 's almost like getting one free . my pack also came with different color rings , that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart . it 's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well . keep smiling....laurie"

pos,"i have owned a copy of this film for a long time . i have probably watched it ten times , and i always tear up a little at each viewing . from the beginning newsreel , of a shell-shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone , to the final reel of harvey milk 's prophetic and haunting statements , the viewer is mesmerized . though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor , his election in the 1970 's , that of an open and unrepentant gay man , made national headlines . he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere , who at that time were unrepresented and , for the most part , still forced into the closet . this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk , but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time . milk was a very eloquent speaker , and his sensibility , logic , and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent . this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs , a buffoon like character , who not only was a terrible speaker , who could n't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears , but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk . the public view at that time was about family values , with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways ( old times come round again... . ) . milk 's voice opposed this view openly , and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented . the notion of this martyrdom , and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk , has been argued . nevertheless , his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued , and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message , nor the admiration he deserves . this film unfolds as it happened , seeming like fiction , but all too real . as milk is assassinated , along with the mayor , by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white , whose subsequent trial , with the famous "" twinkie defense "" , and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders , resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen . as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation , ... if only the mayor had been killed , white would have gotten life , but the fact that milk , a gay man , had also been killed , leaned public sympathy towards white , an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.there are many moving , telling , historically signifigant moments in this film , but none so clearly represents those times , and milk 's loss and legacy , as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders . seas of people , holding candles and standing silently , came together in a very moving moment in time . this film , which won best documentary at that years oscars , transcends its subject matter , and is simply a great documentary . gay rights have made much progress . and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all , excluding those who were there , are old enough to remember , or are gay . nonetheless , harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement , and his legacy , through schools named after him , organizations , and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless , lives on ."

neg,"i echo the comments of the previous reviewers . do n't waste your money . not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual u2 fan , it ca n't even get those facts right ! the book states that bono 's father dropped the family off at a catholic church before driving himself to another church . this contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that bob hewson was catholic , while bono , his mother and brother were protestant . in the same paragraph the dublin neighborhood of "" glasnevin "" is misspelled "" asnevin "" . the hearing aid shop from which bono took his name is misspelled , and perhaps most galling of all , the author ca n't even get the full name of larry mullen , jr. right ! and this is just chapter one ! i have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing . i would suggest skipping this one and purchasing bono : in conversation with michka assayas , which includes a pretty good account of bono 's life from the man himself ."

neg,"the venona secrets is a deceptive book . it tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of soviet spying in the us , but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing "" liberals "" than in painting a true portrait of their subject . although the information the authors provide is interesting , the biased and heavy-handed way it 's presented negates whatever scientific value it might have . for example , the authors insist that j . robert oppenheimer was working for the soviets ( they call this a "" fact "" ) yet they present absolutely no proof that oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic , naive man who could n't keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of communism in america was money to the cpusa . the book is full of these so-called "" facts "" with little to nothing to back them up . the authors praise joe mccarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti-communist hysteria of the 1940 's and 1950 's , ignoring the fact that mccarthy capitalized on fears of communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal . mccarthy 's methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by stalin are completely overlooked , as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign . the authors also praise senator henry jackson as some sort of all-american crusader against communism , not even mentioning that all of jackson 's anti-communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti-semistism and hatred of blacks . overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of liberal ideology - - one can simply hear the disdain for liberals dripping from the authors ' prose - - and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of venona . the authors have sacrificed their credibility for their conservative agenda ; they deserve not to be taken seriously"

pos,"when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i 'd always be loyal to film . digital could never take the place of film . i 'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely . there 's still something i love about putting a roll of film in the camera , shooting away , sending the film to be processed , and seeing the results . i also know it 's a bit expensive . i know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion , but digital cameras are improving in this regard , and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving , we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital slr and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera . so i figured now is the time to get a digital slr . i have been a loyal nikon user for nearly ten years , and have owned the nikon n60 , n70 , and n80. my first love was , and still is the n70 ( i 've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought i was the only person who loved the n70 ) . i purchased the n80 only after my n70 cost too much to repair , but i 've enjoyed the way my various nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if i do n't have the time to use specific controls , but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes . my nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes , wildlife shots and all sorts of other things i ca n't resist to capture forever . i decided to purchase the d70 since it was close to what i 've already experienced with nikon . in many ways it works in a similar way to the n70 and 80 , except it 's a digital rather than film version . like the film versions of the midrange nikon slr 's , it has a dial that allows an automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , and night portrait modes , the ability to select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . the camera has auto and manual focus abilities . photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires . the controls are easy to use , though it takes practice to be comfortable . on a personal level , the camera has passed the halloween test , niece 's birthday test , and fall foliage in new england test and favorite scenic spots test . the only real difficulty i 've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting . auto focus has not worked at all and i 'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots , but at this point i 'm sure it 's the photographer and not the camera . i do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera . the manual is very confusing . it uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else . i 've had luck with the "" magic lantern guides "" with my other cameras , but have not as of yet used it for this camera . i did purchase the nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which has been helpful . it can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography ."

pos,"truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he / she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the "" crawlers "" attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force"

pos,"i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it 's year of release , 1986. prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "" purple rain , "" both the film and the soundtrack . and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal , which is what they did to prince in those days . many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip . they could n't believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself . it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that is n't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy . of course , poor critical response alone does n't usually keep the public from making a movie popular . yet "" under the cherry moon "" was a bomb at he box office . probably the main reason for this is that the movie , although shot in color , was released in black-and-white . for some unfathomable reason , the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie . now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves . i 'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color . i will acknowledge that this movie 's target audience is prince fans . since i am one myself , and have been most of my life , i 'm not the most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies for my love of this movie . it 's not a "" guilty pleasure "" for me , because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites . i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release - and unfotunately i missed it in theaters ( i could n't get anyone to take me , i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "" grafitti bridge "" on opening night , but that 's for another review ) . but since it 's dvd release in 2004 , this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection . the soundtrack is killer , the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever . there 's even some great stuff heard in the movie that did n't make the album ( some of which was issued on 12 "" vinyl ) . plus , i think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was michael ballhaus , who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit ( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how the movie would feel in color , but i do think black-and-white was the right way to go . even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times , it has the feel of something from the ' 30s . there are so many classic moments in this movie , i wo n't try to list them all . but here are a few.. . christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his "" bela lugosi eyes "" ...tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath...christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "" wreka stow "" scene...the car race between christopher and mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . as for the acting , i 've heard a lot of people saying that prince 's performance was no good . i do n't see much truth in that claim . after being so serious in "" purple rain , "" it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this . jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side ( as in "" purple rain "" ) - i 'm surprised jerome has n't done much additional acting outside of prince movies . and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this , her first major role , to become an oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how is the dvd presentation ? pretty good , for such a largely overlooked movie . the widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix are n't anything phenomenal , but get the job done nonetheless ; the movie looks and sounds fine . as for features , anyone expecting a full-blown special edition like the 2-disc "" purple rain "" will be disappointed . but at least it 's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included , though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio / visual quality ( though they are passable , i would 've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . the highlight is the live performance of "" anotherlover "" which was taken from a never-released ( at least not domestically , not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u.s. ) concert video documenting the parade tour . mtv held an interesting ( i.e. - very weird ) contest to determine where "" under the cherry moon "" would have it 's world premiere . the ten-thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere , which would be held in their hometown . mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "" purple rain "" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "" under the cherry moon "" ' s dvd release . lisa barber was the contest winner , and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan , wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere . when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan , prince summed it up with a single word : "" purple .

pos,"i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past christmas . i am a physical therapist , and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction . i have tried out many cushions over the years , and from my experience , this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent . the composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained , so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use , and the burgundy cover is removable and washable . it is also an excellent size for the average-sized person ( my dad is approximately 5'9 "" , ~170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products . most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives , like a massager , ribbing on the contours of the cushion , etc. i 've found that simply maintaining good posture ( not only in sitting , but all activity ) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution that commercial products are not a cure-all to one 's problems . it 's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms , but other steps are necessary in terms of fixing the problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist , as it is more than likely necessary that one would need ( at least ) proper education and intevention to help one to get better ."

neg,"if you believe in the devil , and i mean *really* believe in the devil , i ca n't think of one good reason why you 'd want to summon the devil into this world . at worst , he 's purported to be the father of lies , and one of the fallen angels . this means that anything he tells you is suspect , anything he gives you is suspect , and he probably has the power to make you believe in him . yikes . not a safe trip . not a terribly sane trip , for that matter . yet that is precisely what boris balkan ( frank langella ) desired . he had one copy of "" the nine gates of the kingdom of shadow "" , and there were three extant . one or all of these books is a forgery , and one or all holds the secret to summoning satan . he hires corso ( played a bit too understated by johnny depp ) to research the other texts . the movie is based on the novel "" the club dumas "" by arturo perez reverte , which i favorably reviewed . i ca n't give a similar review to the ninth gate for a number of reasons . first , depp 's portrayal of corso was one dimensional , and corso was a multi-dimensional character . whether that 's the filmmaker 's fault or depp 's i do n't know , but depp 's corso was a dreadful bore . a mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his , demonstrating supernatural abilities . we are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping corso , or in what her abilities might have been ( never mind her identity ) . yet since this is a character from the book , i know why she was there , i have a pretty good idea who she was ( and good job to the author on how he handled that ! ) and her character 's interests and abilities could have been better communicated , with very little difficulty . also , in a rather silly departure from the book ( departures are fine...i 'm not being a book snob ) , they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall , white , and physically imposing . there 's nothing that irritates me more than a "" quota substitute "" . i do n't think this particular sub had any speaking lines , which makes it that much more of an insult . i love intelligent thrillers . ( i did n't care for the da vinci code . ) this was a thriller that spent time in libraries , that examined woodcuttings drawn , perhaps , by lucifer himself - yet i was n't engaged . in 1999 , when the film was released , i could n't sit through it . after reading the club dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two , i approached the film again , hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help . it did not . in fact , it raised more questions . i would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3 ; however , i 'm reviewing the dvd and the dvd gets a big spanking for not having subtitles . there 's no excuse , in this day and age , for a mainstream dvd not to offer subtitles ."
pos,"i believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. forget about zoom lenses even if they are l . this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. with zoom lenses you have to set to f / 5.6 for better result and f / 8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135 / 2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200 / 1.8 and 300 / 2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm / 1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "" in stock soon "" . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. very fast lens with f / 2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast / color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast / quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d / 20d / rebel / 300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait"

neg,"having been a casual fan of stax records for a few years ; i decided earlier this year that i should go all out and splurge on this 9-cd box set . big mistake . i have many , many complaints about this set ; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess . it misses many key b-sides such as otis redding 's "" hard to handle "" and booker t & the mg 's "" tic tac toe "" ; and does n't even include every a-side the label released , despite the title of the compilation ( where are the sides that hoyt johnson released for the label ? ) . the linear notes by steve greenberg ( the man who gave us that phony "" soul queen "" joss stone ; and the headache-inducing baha men ) are horrible , mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and / or songs rather than the stories behind them . and within the sections for each disc in the booklet ; they entries are n't actually arranged in any particular order ( least of all the order of the tracks on the cds , that would make too much sense ) . and there should 've been more photos , too . add to this the set 's main problem : the music . the fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame . seriously . "" why did you buy it , then ? "" i hear you say . well ; the stax songs i was familiar with ( such as "" green onions "" ; "" b-a-b-y "" ; "" you do n't miss your water "" ; "" ( sittin ' on ) the dock of the bay "" ; "" soul man "" ; "" born under a bad sign "" etc ) are all great songs . "" well , why do n't you like this set then "" you 're thinking . answer : because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs . if you think i 'm being harsh on these songs , i 'm not ; i can appreciate songs like wendy rene 's "" bar-b-q "" and the memphis nomad 's "" do n't pass your judgement "" ; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers , most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad . basically , if you really like a stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist ; if your looking for a sampler of stax 's best songs , then go and buy the 4-cd stax story ; do n't bother with this one"

pos,"for me , this movie is very different than other holocaust movies , in that it explores the issue of what happened to jewish spouses of aryan women...the story itself is based on a true occurrence , and the movie begins with a wake...the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime berlin & shows disapproval at her daughter 's choice of a non-jewish fiance...the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother 's past than she was ever told , and travels to germany to discover her mother 's past...the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences , and basically focusses on the plight of aryan women in berlin whose jewish husbands have been confined in a place called rosenstrasse...i wo n't give too much away , but i must say that for a slow-paced movie , it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the jewish spouses...as for the acting , the characters from the past did an excellent job , their performances were very realistic , and heart-wrenching , especially the actress who plays the main role of mrs fabian fischer , the aryan wife . in the present day , the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother 's past was n't very convincing , but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie , and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot"

pos,"i bought an epilator because i was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me . i 've had my epilator for several weeks now and i am already seeing amazing results ! i used it for the first time on my legs . i 'm not going to lie...it was painful . i just made sure to go slowly , pausing every few inches , and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as i could get it . eventually , i was able to get most of the thick , dark hairs off of my legs . **please know that the epilator is not an immediate "" cure-all "" . hair grows in stages , so as soon as you get rid of some hairs , several more grow in behind them . ( eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them , but it will take some time . ) because of this , it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week . since it 's winter , i just let it all grow out so that the epilator can get more hairs . however , when new hair grows in , i am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown . it does n't hurt nearly as much to pull those out ! i also know that i 'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter . my legs are smoother and i do n't get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i do experience a little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just a short time . another neat thing is that , unlike waxing , the epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth ! i used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed . now , i get smoother skin just about whenever i want to ! i was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product i had not heard much about . with the exception of the few reviews i read online , i was pretty much in the dark . i went ahead and went for it , then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks ! not only have i epilated my legs , i have also used it under my arms , on my upper lip , and on my bikini line . the results have been better than i could have imagined ! ! again , i 'm not going to lie...ouch ! ! ! ! ! epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days ( i have very thick hairs ) . however , i got the majority of the hairs and after the first time , i realized that i 'm never going to have to shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they are all thinner and much less painful . in fact , sometimes it tickles a little . :o ) i epilate there once to twice a week ( about a five minute job if you 're being careful , two if you 're in a hurry ) and i have smoother underarms ! i used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just for a second . plus , i keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax , i only need to pull 5-10 each time . **a word of caution : our skin is more sensitive in some areas , so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line , be careful . i managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating "" blade "" . now i just make sure that i do n't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back another time to get them . this epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs ( i 've only had a few and the pad fixes them ) and a little cleaning brush . the epilator is very easy to clean . the top ( dark purple section ) pops off and you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back on . **note , the epilator does not store hairs inside of it . when they are pulled out , they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator ( i stop periodically to wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs . i hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator . i am very satisfied with this product and i recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time . **are the few minutes of pain worth it ? ? ? absolutely ! :o )"

neg,"the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame . like bergman 's "" scenes from a marriage "" & "" fanny & alexander , "" von trier 's "" the kingdom , "" fassbinder 's "" berlin alexanderplatz , "" kusturica 's "" underground , "" and petersen 's "" das boot , "" the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers ' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run . unlike these other series , kieslowski 's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) . the stories of the dekalog are morality plays , but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments , but rather inspired by them , and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two . kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland 's best up & coming director 's to do each , as was initially planned ) , and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories . i wo n't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so , and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them , so i will comment on kieslowski 's style . kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature . his films often tackle issues of political import , however he intentionally avoids making "" issue films , "" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected , as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture . his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before , during & after the solidarity movement . initially he started as a documentary film maker , but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects , he switched to his unique fictional style . this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available , in that the picture quality is a little better , however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series . first , facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu . to add to that , you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode , very annoying . then the picture quality is n't as good as it could be . not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) , but the film is n't a true digital copy of the original series , but rather a copy of someone 's pal tape of the broadcast , so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape . the picture is also cropped from the original , especially on the bottom . the picture at times jitters , especially during the ending credits . the english subtitles are minimal , at times missing dialogue , and can not be turned off . there are some nice extra features , particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists . however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog , and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead . apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition , which is inexcusable given the price"

pos,"back in the early 90s i was going through a bad acne period . i finally visited a dermatologist , and he put me on an accutane regimen . i had sensitive skin and a tough beard , so regular shaving cream was too harsh ( especially while taking accutane - the solid brush-on cream i was using at the time burned the edges of my lips ) . he recommended that i shave with cetaphil . years later , my skin and beard are still troublesome . therefore , i 've kept cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen . cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver . it 's not harsh or irritating , even on a freshly shaved face . however , it 's kind of cold in the morning , which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers . so i put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff . by the time i 'm done , it 's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two . however , even though cetaphil feels good and lubricates well , its consistency is a bit thin to use alone . i like a good lather , so i combine cetaphil with kiss my face moisture shave , which was recommended to me by a woman working at gnc . they mix well together , and i get a good , non-irritating shave by using the gillette fusion power razor . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i apply a product that contains salicylic acid , such as clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . if you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me , then make cetaphil part of your shaving routine . recommended"

pos,"being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it- - "" daydream nightmare "" and "" outlaw blues "" . at first i was a little puzzled- -the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were- -grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go ' round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle- -it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine- -it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is- -the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar / sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another "" weak link "" on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing / recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored"

neg,"after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory , this sequel was an absolute let-down . the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie 's ( formerly wonka 's ) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth . while beyond the reaches of earth 's atmosphere , our heroes- --charlie , grandpa joe , and mr. wonka- --must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids ( pronounced "" k'nids "" ) , aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes . far worse than these beasties , though , are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless . charlie , joe , and wonka , with no help from charlie 's folks or other grandparents , save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory , where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills , returning them to infancy or beyond . charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites , who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters . at the end of the novel , the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president . in short , these three are the most tedious , spiteful , unredeemable characters i 've come across in children 's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book . as it is , they ( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory ) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last . their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore , rather than a joy , to read ."

pos,"this camera has been called a "" pro-sumer "" model and you should really take that title seriously . the quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution . the trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you 're moving it to or from a bag . to compound this problem , the lens extends ( in your bag ) , pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage . so , if you think of this as a professional camera , to be kept in a real camera-case , you 'll probably be okay . if you 're somebody , like me , who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket , you 're going to be annoyed by the power switch . that said , i do love the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on ; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily ; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? ) pros : awesome pictures ; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture"

neg,"the first novel of laurell k . hamilton 's merry gentry series is not , actually , that terrible a book . it 's by far the best in a not particularly great series , actually . what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise , the set-up , is one of the most grotesquely , ridiculously stupid things i 've ever read . princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie , in fear of death at the hands of her aunt , andais , the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court . high profile fae in this world are major public figures , like rock stars or the royal family of england . the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed . every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away . we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings . meredith 's image , the story of her mysterious disappearance , is everywhere . i mean , neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is , and what she looks like . meanwhile , princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye . thing is , she has n't disguised herself very much at all . her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin . her fae red hair is now human red hair . her facial features remain the same . and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith , for years on end , no one recognizes her . let me hasten to add , there is no magic involved in this , they honestly simply do n't recognize her . and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise , the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she 's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry . jesus wept . and for years , none of her co-workers , no one who knows her , says to themself , "" hey , wait a minute , that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god , merry gentry is princess meredith !

neg,"do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done- -in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "" right click "" menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us "" printing "" to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's "" option "" for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the "" convert to adobe pdf "" button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose "" this feature will not be available "" from the "" microsoft outlook "" option under "" acrobat pdfmaker "" under "" create adobe pdf "" . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "" convert to adobe pdf "" and "" combine in acrobat.. . "" entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( "" adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally "" ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc. ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the "" improvements "" in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )"

"" anxiously awaiting a "" no "" so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity . he replied , "" you mean bob evans . "" yes indeed , it seems he knows everybody . my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy's . i asked , "" do you know what he does now ? "" "" he 's some sort of movie director or something now , is n't he . "" , dad answered . i bought him the audiobook . evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook , both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name . his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess . he also lent his voice to the short-lived , hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central . all in all , whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating , beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg 's and selznick 's combined . the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on . this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown . ps:i do n't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc . what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody . ask your dad . who knows ?"

pos,"i have to say that i have been converted . for over 15 years now i lived with a razor . i have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too . i am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon . i have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade . i have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the gillette brand is the best type of razor , but now i find it 's not the best shave . i used an electric shaver several years back , it was one of the top of the line norelco with the incorporated gel . it gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs ; i ended up having to shave as normal . - -true story- - i am a manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item i was marked bad was my personal appearance . not that i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but that they felt i did n't shave often . ( i shave at the very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i had to so something about it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer . i found that panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had . the instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut . i have been using it for almost 30 days now , and i will not live without it . i have never had this close of a shave before . i can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow . my fiancé has found a new love for touching my face , and i seem to be getting more kisses too ! during the first 2 weeks i had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old gillette , but today officially i was able to through my gillette away for good . ( my boss has even asked what i am doing different and when i told him , he went out and bought one too , he also loves it now . my fiancé said she would leave me if i stopped using the panasonic , it 's a good thing panasonic has been around for decades ) so , i am raving about his product , but every good has its bad.. . what the bad ? well , it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave , but for the amount of time i am planning to use it and the money i am saving from buying razors every month , i can handle that . the cleaning system is very good , but it takes very long to clean ( 2-3 hrs ) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles . the cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week . i have not gotten to that point yet , but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash . i just end up using the base for the drying cycle , which is an option . the batter is very good . in the month i have used it , i have charged it twice but it really did n't need it as it said the charge was good . overall.. . excellent product . could there be a better shaver out there , maybe , will i ever know.. . at this time , i am not worried about it , i am very satisfied with this panasonic , and do n't think it can get any better . this product does not include the cleaning base . i do recommend it as even if you do n't use it to clean the razor , you can use it to dry it , it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying . but , if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor , this is it !"

neg,"although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions ."

neg,"king vidor 's rather contrived adaptation of tolstoy 's epic riddled with miscast actors , a boring script , and a hurried screenplay . in short , another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into hollywood 's vaults of oblivion . the story follows the main characters of tolstoy 's novel such as natasha ( audrey hepburn ) , prince andrei ( mel ferrer ) , and pierre ( henry fonda . ) the film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks : particularly that of henry fonda as pierre . henry fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film ; his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad charleton heston film . as far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer , they are as sparse as they are realistic . all of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake . in short , the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that hollywood bothered to put it on dvd . apart from that , the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue . do n't buy this film"
neg,"this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders , though it 's hard to say which . it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot , more or less . whether that 's more insulting to the male brain or the female body , i 'm not sure , but the book portrays neither gender realistically . i like heinlein , and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential , but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass , and it 's not even particularly good at being that . the gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so , but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature . more 's the pity"

pos,"i looked at this camera the panasonic hvx200 , the sonys , the jvc 200 , and even canon 's bigger brother the x1. i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo.net , a great video forum . my concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction - there really is n't a difference . i like tape vs the hvx 's expensive storage solutions . one concern i had was , will it look like a pro camera ? that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent . as soon as i opened the box i was in love ! this is a really substantial camera . especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided , this does not look like your mama 's camcorder . i really like the manual controls , so that you do n't have to go thru menus to change parameters . the layout of everything is great . i really like the dual on / off and zoom controls - top of handle plus rear right side . holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very , very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned . only down side - and it is incidental . the matte box is a bit flimsy - lightweight plastic . that helps with weight , but i worry about breaking it . some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro , but my eye does not see it . the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light . if you are looking for point and shoot , this is not your baby , but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price - this is it"

neg,"i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "" female "" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "" spring "" cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe "" portrait / landscape "" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords"

neg,"i am by no means a computer idiot , i audit computer systems security for a living . i have had to contact customer support ( webchat ) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software . the install was on a brand new system ( windows xp pro ) , with all of the microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed . first pest patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an active protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes ( which you had to click to clear each one ) . second , the firewall would tell me i was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode . third , pest patrol never would run a thorough scan . i 'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the pest patrol gui , or that system resources was not available . i contacted the customer support and they told me that yes , sometimes pest patrol does n't work at all unless you use msconfig to disable all startup services ( systems.ini , etc ) reboot , run pest patrol , then use msconfig to enable the startup services . it was a canned reply during a live web session , which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people . i have n't tried out the third solution yet because i wanted to remind myself to write an amazon review . if you are looking for simplicity , or do n't know much about computers , look elsewhere . otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds . i 'll give it two stars , since it did n't cause my dog to choke , explode my house , or cause irreparable damage to clothing ( which is my one-star ) ."

neg,"i 'll give the leads the benefit of the doubt that they 're actually a lot better than this lame-o-flick deserves . kutcher and murphy are tom and sara , the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs . after a whirlwind romance , sara introduces tom to her tony beverly hills family . they marry and the rest ( much like their marriage ) is quickly history . things go bad from the wedding night ( bloody noses , no sex ) and only get worse . after tom nearly burns down the french chalet that sara booked them into ( after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in europe and an electric sex-toy ) , and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in venice ( cockroaches , dust and no sex ) , our heroes quickly realize that they are on the honeymoon-from-hell . at first they gamely make a go of it , not realizing that they 're only saving their tension for the perfect moment . "" just married "" was a simple idea for a flick . people have been laughing at marriage for years . maybe that 's why the jokes seem forced - the sex-toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh , and we get that one early on . every joke is actually half of a joke about sara and tom ca n't have sex , climaxing ( really , no pun intended - i mean it ! ) when sara tricks custom 's inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full-rectal exam ( cut to the scene of tom walking bow-legged onto the plane ; obviously he 's the victim , but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non-comedy , you 've got to wonder whether tom is actually the victor - he at least got some . ) the script ca n't get past a monumental plot gap : tom and sara really do n't have anything in common - you 'd think they 'd have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated , but the story skips past much of that . tom 's the hero , but he 's an idiot - the script makes him out as the ugly american , an utterly dated cliche ( he 's surprised that nobody in europe watches american baseball ; he 's the kind of idiot who uses "" american "" instead of "" english "" when referring to language - as in "" why is n't there a sign in american warning against using us voltage sex-toys in france ? "" the laughs are far and few in between - the best ones involve cars ( both the ridiculous sub-compact they rent in france , and the dodge barracuda ( at least i think it 's a ` cuda ) that tom drives - a monster which was probably meant to remind us about "" that 70 's show "" but which looks like a prop from the "" phantasm "" movies . if ever there was a flick that needed help from "" the tall man "" , this is it"
pos,"i 'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy . however , despite annoying design features , this is quite an amazing piece of software ! i would certainly rate it a 5+ if there were n't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ; ) for starters , the educational intent of this software was well thought out . young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it ! the game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults . the graphics and characters are great . the explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises . the program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve . the product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and i found this description to be accurate so i wo n't repeat it . i spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and i had a lot of fun ! i did n't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively . he also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did i . this definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children . the overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play . there is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game . embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills . these can be selected from within an animated room , which gives the player some freedom of choice . additionally , there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess , but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges . i also think it 's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price . this gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available . there are other online chess communities that are free , but i still think this is a nice added bonus . i do n't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child . it 's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine . however , you ca n't play a game of chess against the computer with it . it is only a teaching tool . however , you can buy fritz grandmaster software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability . i 've heard criticisms of fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value . in fact , at this point there seems to be some bugs with fritz 9. if you purchase this product , you wo n't be disappointed . i wish they had it when i was learning to play chess"

"" ( fangoria ) yeah it is surprising , surprising-ly bad . it 's also provocative , it provoked me to write this bad review . from the beginning i could tell the director , chris fisher , was attempting to create a stylistic film . however , after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work i gave up . if you 're using style , have a reason . style without reason is not style . this film is one thing , if nothing else , a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots ( also known as crossdisolving shots ) . drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you 'll get the same effect as the camera work / editing of the film . there 's so much overlapping shots in this film , there 's probably 2 1 / 2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is . it 's full of tallent , bad tallent . it 's more about naked women , sex , and drugs than the actual story . i expected a cheap nock-off of the life of david gale . i would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this . this is bad , annoyingly bad . some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing . annette davey , the editor , should have her name removed from the film . unless , for some unknown reason , she 's proud of her work . if i was studio head at silver nitrate entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film , i 'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired , immediately without question . sony pictures home entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film . if you enjoy good movies and great camera work , stay away from this film"

neg,""" house of mirth "" is one of the most depressing movies i 've ever seen . to be clear : i 've seen movies like , oh , say , "" schindler 's list , "" or "" the heart is a lonely hunter "" that treat tragic events , either in the macrocosm or the microcosm , that did not leave me depressed . rather , they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think . "" house of mirth "" deals with tragic themes , including human society 's ability to destroy its own , and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites . it was n't , though , moving or thought provoking . i was n't moved by gillian anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . i did n't believe gillain anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . rather , i was bored . i kept wanting the film to go faster . it 's a great irony ; edith wharton 's novels are real page turners . quick , to the point . hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality . "" house of mirth "" has gorgeous clothing and sets . i did n't care about anybody onscreen , though . i did n't believe anybody onscreen . i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda , and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces , as if to prove these points : people are hypocrites , see ! people are insincere , see ! if a person has any decency at all , that person is destroyed , see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points . so ... why do i need to watch this movie ? also , as a woman , who , as lily bart was meant to , has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that , i felt that this movie , no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally , betrayed lily bart . lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film . she all but participates in her own destruction . you want , just once , for her to show some initiative , some intelligence , some ability to create her own fate . the film denies her those abilities . in this crippling of lily bart , the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does . movies like "" gone with the wind "" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning , and occasionally gaining some power , imo , are much easier to watch . one might argue that such films are not realisitic . i do n't know . even we real-life lily barts have our resources , and our triumphs . and , again , watching lily bart in "" house of mirth "" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me . it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine ."

pos,"how families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie , but stage and tv director jerry zaks , screenwriter scott mcpherson , and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant . based on a play by mcpherson before he succumbed to aids , the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged , middle-aged sisters . in florida , mousey spinster bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father marvin and their eccentric aunt ruth . in ohio , lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in ohio only to see things fall apart . lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to lee and her sons as potential bone-marrow transplant candidates . the rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable . intriguingly , while the soap opera elements are strictly by-the-numbers , there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece . it also helps that meryl streep and diane keaton play the sisters . as the embittered , guilt-ridden lee , streep moves easily back into blue-collar , silkwood territory , and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self-centered character . however , it 's a vanity-free keaton who really radiates as bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances . a year before "" titanic "" , leonardo di caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as lee 's oldest son hank , a textbook example of teenaged , pyromaniac angst . the rest of the cast is fine in limited turns - robert deniro ( one of the producers as well ) as the bumbling dr. wally ; dan hedaya as his even more pixilated brother bob ; gwen verdon as wild-eyed , soap opera-obsessed aunt ruth ; hal scardino as hank 's self-controlled little brother charlie ; and hume cronyn , who is forced to play marvin with severely limited expression . there are predictable moments throughout , but some surprise and a few actually enthrall , including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when bessie recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend . there are no extras with the 1999 dvd release"

neg,"i was really looking forward to reading "" ever after "" when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by larry gelbart . but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight . here are the three things i learned from this book : ( 1 ) mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt ; ( 2 ) andrew lloyd webber is the anti-christ ; ( 3 ) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off-broadway ( mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center ) . most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each , with very few illuminating details . here 's what the author says about "" carrie , "" perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop : "" carrie , of course , was an instant classic , a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals . adapated by michael gore ( music ) and don pitchford ( lyrics ) from the notorious stephen king novel ( and even more notorious film ) , this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may , 1988 and was gone by the 15th , touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible , monumental ineptitude . "" does that really tell us very much about this musical ? did barry singer even see the show ? you sure would n't know it from this description . and just what , i wonder , makes king 's novel "" notorious "" or the movie "" even more notorious "" ? almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention , but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber-bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery . the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb , if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book , but also because it 's one of the few times that singer goes into any detail . aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes , this book is a waste of time ."

pos,"according to charles kimball , religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth . religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests , while at the same time , more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution . using a comparative religious approach , kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil . kimball argues the word ` religion ' is amorphous and difficult to define . as a result , the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary , one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions . kimball , next , asks if religion is the cause of evil , and he answers both yes and no . a religion that is arrogant , condescending , and requires adherents to "" disconnect their brain "" is problematic . on the other hand , religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community . kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil . the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims . when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine , the propensity towards evil increases dramatically . sacred texts , sources of wisdom and guidance , become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims . christianity and islam have missionary mandates , but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims . kimball argues for a "" human view of truth "" , one that is dynamic and relational , allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions . another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience : when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities . when a charismatic leader demands total obedience , has unrestricted power , and has total control , religion is unhealthy . uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy , as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection . strict segregation from the larger society , combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous . kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence . every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth , while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future . when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time , the likelihood for disaster increases . many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society , zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status , and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind . kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god 's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous . religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means : when one theological component gets elevated , thus becoming an end , and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end . all religions have notions of sacred space , but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space . reinforcing or protecting group identity against an ` other ' , or protecting group identity from within the group , are also potentially dangerous signs . institutional structures develop in all religious traditions , but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end . kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends . the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a "" holy "" war . kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity , and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91. islam is a peaceful religion , which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order . the word jihad means "" struggling in the way of god , "" but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory . because of socio-economic disparities , some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends , and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause . kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy . with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil , religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis . faith , hope , and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents , so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted . against secularism , kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards , and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity . with religious diversity christians have three options , exclusivism , inclusivism , and pluralism , but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity . finally , the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community : if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict , then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak"
neg,"as a teacher i use word , powerpoint , and publisher when working with students and engaging in professional activities ( presentations to organizations , etc. ) i have been using office 2002 , and thought i should upgrade . big mistake . the ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through , especially since i previously just customized the toolbar so everything i needed was immediately available . i 'm still trying to figure out how to type in chinese , although the spanish and german are working fine . additionally , they 've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons / icons / etc. as a previous commenter noted , making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems , and i also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber . it took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual , and i ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar . the designs in publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate . in previous versions , you could see the stark differences between different designs . in the current options pages , everything is so soft , both in line and color , as well as being so small , that it 's hard to tell what you 're looking at . but the truly big disappointment is powerpoint . their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill- -i would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007. i have reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all the money i spent on this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely have to have a pc because you do a lot of word processing , stick with word 2002 or 2003. if you need to do presentations / brochures / etc. for your business , get a mac and avoid this problem altogether"

neg,"i feel duped ! i bought spy sweeper at the computer store a year ago . it was the 2.6 version . at first everything was great . i got my definitions , it found traces , it detected spy cookies . when i ran the definition update , i had no problem with the firewall . every time they said upgrade , i did . then i started getting renew e-mail . i had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and i ignored them , not only because i knew the year was n't up , but i also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information . i e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them , voicing my concerns . i got ignored , to when i eventually got to speak to someone , they did n't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like ! the problems began when i updated the latest version which is the 4.5. when i would try to update my definitions i 'd get a warning that there 's was a problem and contact webroot , while it had no problem noting that i had the latest version updates . no settings were changed , not even my firewall which was blamed by them . i think it 's them not me since now it 's suddenly happening . they refuse to address it . then i checked their site about my subscritpion . i knew i had one because i bought it at the store , my subscription does n't expire until june and if i was invalid i doubt i could upgrade to newer versions . what did their page say ? no subscription ! when i wrote i never got a straight answer about it . then i was told that the program was corrupted , download a new copy of the latest version from their site . i did . what did i get ? boxes that said subscription not activated . they knew i had one and they wo n't change it on their site or give me explanations . after pestering does my latest version now say when i expire . i 've asked why it goes online to scan when it does n't need to and i get ignored . so i decided to call but was n't sure how because i 'm in a different time zone . it took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their mountain time is treated like my eastern time to get a hold of someone . the first person i spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each , was nasty , especially when i told him to slow down because he mumbled . i downloaded what he told me to do , he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.the second person sounded like he 'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings . he did n't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying i had no subscription when the program in it 's latest version finally admitted i 'm current after pestering . they do n't give you straight e-mail answers . they do n't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you 'll give up . it wo n't scan everything even when no other programs are running . in the new version it found a spy cookie , it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as "" always remove "" .never did that with the previous versions . i do n't like a company who answers questions selectively . i do n't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings . i do n't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions . webroot 's spy sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works , and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status"

pos,"alliterative analogies , assertively assembled , appear aplenty , appropriately , apt and artful , absorbing attention ad infinitum . this could be a fitting summary of abish 's stunningly & quot ; now&quot ; novel , written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration . chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a , chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 , when z first , then chapter by chapter all other letters , are progressively subtracted . in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature , the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary , they may have been culled from today 's headlines : polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree , with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them . chasing after the thugs from country to country , we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite , war and genocide , corrupted burocrats and soldiers , rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air , where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence . all is narrated with poetic detachment , in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social , political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality : it is just that the words were limited by my artifice , reader , the author seems to smile . no harm intended . perhaps : the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 , to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy . great art , when unhindered , relates to the whole of time , in all tenses . while amusing , abish has managed a ponderous read , which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices , inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events . attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme . and wonder : was it accidental ? & quot ; in order to be perfect , all i lack is a defect&quot ; goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet"
neg,"this movie was so horrible i do n't know where to start . maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street . or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale . secondly , i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles . if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays , why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...if you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience . furthermore , i thought the bible said a little something against divorce ; like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery / fornication . this movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of god if you 're in love . in fact , christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where ce-ce peniston 's character says seductively , "" i 'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus "" yet she 's dressed like a hooker . speaking of clothing , why did ce-ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene . they go on a date and she 's dressed one way , by the time they come home she has on something different ; with no logical explanation . and please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of rico suave . maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream . i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him . in addition , the soundtrack , it-was-just-annoying . at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music . i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly , it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate ( although some are ) however , having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just , well , almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large . overall , this movie made me want to puke . pastor larry "" flash "" jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity"
neg,"20 minutes into this movie i was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based . the actress playing cleopatra protrays her as petulent , spoiled and immature , whereas in the book one saw cleopatra as highly astute , regal , and concerned first about her country and its people . in the movie she handed egypt to ceasar eagerly , whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to rome . likewise , dalton portrays ceasar as a complete ****. perhaps if this were not based on margaret george 's memiors of cleopatra , i would be more kind in my review , but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second-rate film-maker 's idea of good story-telling . at 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most , but if you really want to learn about this queen , read the book instead ."

pos,"overall i would highly recommend the rosetta stone software even though it 's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method . rosetta stone *combined* with pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language . the disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the cd in the drive any time you are going to use it and you ca n't use a backup copy for safety . the rosetta stone lessons are quick , easy and fun to do , thus encouraging usage . if you can afford it i would definitely recommend combining pimsleur and rosetta stone . both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available . but neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language . could rosetta stone be improved ? certainly . more diverse and better graphics would help . the graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture is n't quite clear as to meaning . for example if you are supposed to select "" a boy on a horse "" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse . if you are questioning if you should get rosetta stone or not , just get a free demo cd from their website and try it yourself . as far as i can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons"

pos,"after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes & noble that same night . dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions ! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors . we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers . however , if at home you are on dr. whitley 's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front . although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of "" mr. rogers "" in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents . of course , that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he / she is capable of "" frightening "" resistance . obviously , professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley 's methods would be more advisable than his book ! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders . these kids still have some moldability and are n't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem ( i.e. depression ) . for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author ; 0 )"

neg,"like other reviewers , after careful research , i decided to purchase this product . it was affordable , received good reviews , and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range . when i received it in mail , i was quite happy : it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what i had expected . the screen was bright and very attractive . the problems started about three weeks following the purchase . first , the slideshow option ( the kind with music ) stopped working . whenever i pushed the slideshow button , the screen would completely freeze and i had to restart the unit in order to use any other function . i thought , no big deal , i would just exchange the frame for another one . my second unit arrived yesterday . this one , however , started having problems right out of the box . after about 5 minutes into the slideshow , the screen started flickering , than shaking , became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically . i played it two more times after that , each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow . it is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential ( big , bright screen ) ; unfortunately , the software is very buggy . i checked the portable usa website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix . i will have to return this unit again , this time for a refund . my assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box . however , i would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership"
neg,"i have had this camera for about a year . it has been nothing but a problem . first , the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems . i have spent hours trying to fix it . still has bugs in it no matter what i do . secondly , the camera is very unreliable . i have a wedding to go to this weekend and i do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too . how do i explain the problems i have had ? there are so many . the camera misfunctions continuously . sometimes it does nothing at all . other times the zoom lense will not shut . you turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option . i sometimes can not even shut the camera off i gotta take the batteries out to do so...if i can even find batteries that work in the camera . honestly , i call tech supoport and told them the problems i have having and they tell me that only kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some . so i went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries . the camera salesman told me that kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter . i believe him . so my camera which would not work...i asked the salesman to help me out . it did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable . he popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked . well , everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life . my camera now does not work with either batteries . probably only kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me . i personally do n't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good . really , when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed . i am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know i gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera . trying to save money on this ' disposable ' camera was a waste . stay away from kodak cameras ! if you do n't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews ."
pos,"we must thank the director and salute sigourney weaver 's beautiful performance : this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle , yet ferocious , giant mountains gorillas . it is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of rwanda , secluded from the world . she lost much of her sanity , as well as her life , in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas . without her work , who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction ? thanks to her work and dedication , a "" lost cause "" had been heard at last . the struggle for the survival of the "" great apes "" is not totally over though . one must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region , as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials ' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna 's loss of habitat , can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved . one must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like diane fossey , conservationists around the world , and the rwandese people in particular , who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures . all hope is not lost !"

neg,"this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations . in that sense , it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans . i have an objection , though , with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously , even gorgeously at times , written . didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and , worse , the result is a cold , humorless , colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup . the author , in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose , apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers . it is , in that sense , a boring little disaster of a book ."

pos,"april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so . it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession . once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best . abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott . for his part , scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states . the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland , a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty . it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia . in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper 's ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia . rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper 's ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic . the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger . did the confederacy in fact lose it 's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period ? david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner . this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author 's writing style is superbly readable . it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome . detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down . this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history . no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it . this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author . this book is well researched , very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia . it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned"

neg,"*no spoilers* we had enough of lame japanese films . this new "" wave "" of horror movies like "" the ring , "" "" pulse "" and now "" the grudge 2 "" does n't seem to have an end . the genre is played out but that did n't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version . to understand this film- -which is nearly impossible until the end- -you would have to see the first movie . brief story : the film has basically three plots , but in a way they are connected to each other . the first plot is a follow-up of what happened to karen davis ( sara michele gellar ) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house . mrs. davis ( joanna cassidy ) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen . she travels to japan to bring sara home . now in japan , she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house , but something terrible is about to happen . the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house . one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we do n't know about . suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child . she tries to get out but the door jammed . they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost . unfortunately , they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited . the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building . a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the "" strange lady "" that lives next door has something to do with it . people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence . review : less scary and sillier than the original , "" the grudge 2 "" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience . the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them . we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other . this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us . they do n't care whether you visit the house or not . now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason . these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way- -even a young little boy- -just to show their rage . the so-called scary moments are not scary at all . they are lame , mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version . what 's sad is that , this time around , the writers have to make the actresses show some "" skin "" to please the male teen audience . this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie . in the technical department the movie does n't do a good job either . the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion . we have three plots that are poorly mixed together . sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us . the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor , but that 's the only thing that resemblances the original . in the sound department , the movie will make you laugh . we hear sillier noises than the original . instead of getting scared , you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make- -we personally like the angry "" kitty "" sound . the verdict : a terrible sequel of a decent horror film , "" the grudge 2 "" could have been a straight-to-video release if it was n't for the beautiful sara michelle gellar . no scary moments but many funny ones- -unintentionally , of course ."
pos,"this book consists of 29 stand-alone essays , beautifully written and previously published in the "" new england journal of medicine "" during the early seventies . from the first chapter : "" the viruses , instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death , now begin to look more like mobile genes...we live in a dancing matrix of viruses ; they dart , rather like bees , from organism to organism , from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again , and into the sea , tugging along pieces of this genome , strings of genes from that , transplanting grafts of dna , passing around heredity as though at a great party . "" although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter , there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates : 1.there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things . 2.there is constant reference to the interaction , symbiosis , and co-operative living arrangements amongst the different species . 3.there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants , bees , and termites , whose activities create sophisticated , developed projects without any evidence of central control . these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities , with the human emphasis being on language . 4.the cell is the unit of life , complete with all its intricate inner workings . the cell membrane ( cell wall in plants ) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible . in the first chapter and frequently throughout , the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism , but he ca n't make it work - too big , too complex , too many working parts without visible connections . then in the last chapter , a better analogy emerges . the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane . this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan , richard feynman , and stephen jay gould . reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about . amazingly , after 30 years , there is a little - but not much - in this book that is out of date . if you are a little rusty on biology , have your "" oxford dictionary of science "" handy . first class ."

pos,"a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp . he also recommended getting his road to hell cd . both of these cd 's were money well spent . i 'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80 's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity , mainly due to his top 20 hit "" fool ( if you think it 's over ) "" . for some reason i never equated that song with this artist . the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity . he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like "" fool "" or "" let 's dance "" and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like "" road to hell "" . no matter what the genre of music , this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove . there 's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd . "" auberge "" and especially the wonderful "" on the beach "" stuck out for me . but you get many styles here . and each song sets a different mood . from the easy listening "" winter song "" or the catchy "" looking for summer "" . or some excellent blues rock like "" road to hell "" , "" god 's great banana skin "" or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea 's tasty slide guitar skills . i do n't know how i missed this artist after all of these years . but i 'm a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album . whatever style that it might be , i 'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of. this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist . if your like me , after hearing this cd you 'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums . i 've since picked up his late 80 's album "" dancing with strangers "" . another very nice cd . most of the music on this best of cd is almost 20 years old , but it feels like it could have been written today . in other words it 's well composed music that holds up very well over time . and i 'm sure if your like me and not familiar with rea 's music , the minute you hear "" fool "" or "" on the beach "" it 's going to bring the good part of the 80 's back to you . greatest hits cd 's should all be this good . highly recommended"

neg,"the literature of september 11 is never attacked . when a book speaks of september 11 ( or of terrorism in general ) , it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism ; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy . jonathan safran foer 's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy , on such reverence . the narrative , which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father ( a narrative stolen , in its basic outline , from guenther grass 's die blechtrommel ) , could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions . nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel : the others include hiroshima / nagasaki , the staten island ferry crash , and the dresden bombings . each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity , but historical "" trauma "" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation . oskar , the insufferable brat , attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father , thomas schell , jr. , a victim of september 11 , by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds , the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "" reading "" - --an almanac which , most likely , is written sometime in the indefinite future ( thomas shell , sr.

"" the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity . we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus- --a very deep truth indeed , one that foer also communicates in his essay , "" emptiness "" ( originally published in playboy ) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel , a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians ( ringo star ) and scientists ( stephen hawking ) are unthreateningly approachable : everything is familiarized . perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close , since the entire book is a vacuum : null space into which readers may project their own meanings . joseph suglia , ph.d . , the author of watch out"

neg,"this movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list . overall , i was somewhat disappointed with this film . i figured there would be a little more real suspense or "" thrill "" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events . the biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between eastwood and russo . it was contrived , lame , and almost laughable . i had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt having a nightmare ! john malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role . unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves . clint eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self . no problem here though , clint was solid . the film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end . the climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although i saw it coming a mile away . there was not as much suspense as i was hoping for and the "" thrill "" was mostly missing . what else can i say , watch it and make your own decision but overall i was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews"
pos,"i have seen these in catalogs before & did n't give them a second thought . then one day when i was cleaning under & around all of my shampoo bottles , etc in the shower , it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos / conditions & body wash that i have collected in my shower . so , i ordered one a higher price & i am so thrilled that i am ordering one for the kids ' bathroom where i had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc. now it will all be in one place , not messy & out of the reach of my toddler ! the other thing that i have noticed is that i do n't use nearly as much shampoo as i did before - i get a few squirts & if that is n't enough , i get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand . i know i use far less shampoo than i did before i had this so i am no longer wasting it ! this is just the greatest concept & this product is very easy to keep clean & it works & looks great in the shower . i would recommend this product to anyone ! & if you do n't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but i found the 4 section one is just what i needed ; one for clarifying shampoo , one for conditioning shampoo , one for conditioner & one for body wash . no more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom"

neg,"the idea is fantastic . the fact is i do n't wake up immediately like bzzzz- -i 'm awake . amazingly i can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it . on this alarm , the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select . i have mine set for 15 minutes , and usually by the time the light has reached maximum i 'm coherent enough to get up . if the light does n't do it , you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls- -ocean , wind , and ringing bells falling somewhere in between . the flaws : as others have mentioned , the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels . so when it first pops on in the morning , you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp . secondly , you do n't set the alarm for when you want to get up . you have to go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point . then you set the alarm for that earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use the sound in addition to the light , it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity , but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless . a workaround we 've found for this is to use the external speaker provided . plug it into the back of the light , run it across the room , and bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick a sound like "" birds "" instead of the lip-curling "" harbor "" or "" town "" . from it 's buried location across the room , the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out . whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking . fourth , the clock lumination can change colors , rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting . at first that looks cool . until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong . the darkest setting is red , and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color . so yes , it works . and it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but the design is just plain stupid . if the manufacturer would wander by here , read this and make a few design changes , they could make a light worth buying"

neg,"feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee 's overpriced "" subscription "" renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot- --just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they 're going to reinstall windows , i 'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i 'll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids ' photos- --well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated "" we received your e-mail "" response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i 'm insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data / spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced . and do n't expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong ."
neg,"i bought a new state-of-the-art computer in february that came preloaded with windows vista . i was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system , and i hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life . i have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine , especially knowing that had i called dell , they would have installed xp instead . pros : -better security ( it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "" automatic "" programs that software makers sneak onto your system ) -better appearance ( this is strictly cosmetic , and i 'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty , useless one ) cons : -freezing : i use this computer 2-3 hours a day and i can expect 1-2 freezes / day . restarting often fails , and i have to cut the power and restart again . -display problems : although the cosmetics of the program were better , vista ca n't display anything right . i tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting . i had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back . apparently , the newest display drivers are incompatible with vista . -incompatibility : entirely too many programs are incompatible with vista , including some fairly big ones ( lots of adobe software , ipods , display drivers , etc. ) i know vista is new , and these software companies are slow to adapt , but does it really make sense for an operating system like vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete ? why ca n't vista play nicely with the other kids ? -its slow ! ! ! - - part of the reason i bought a new , state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop ( which still runs ok , but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years ) . although this computer is light years ahead of the old one , it actually runs even slower than my old laptop . technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of vista . bottom line : 1. if you are not good with computers , avoid vista like the plague 2. vista is a rip-off . save your money and keep / get xp- - i 'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install xp so i can regain some speed and system stability . maybe in the future vista will work ok , but not right now.. . 3. the incompatibility issues- - though there are several- - conspicuously include problems with mac-oriented software ( ipod , adobe ) . i ca n't help but feel that microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle apple"

neg,"the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst , josh hartnett , kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline . this film is directed by sofia coppola ( lost in translation ) , i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself , you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola does n't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time . sometimes magic does not stirke twice . how can all five sisters end up killing themselves , their homelife was n't that unbearable , a lot of parents are religious , but that does n't mean you 'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide . kristen dunst just gets on my nerves , her acting is the same in every film . do n't believe the hype , the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking , poetic film"

pos,"it does the basic job well . the calibration runs smoothly and accurately . hardware looks and feels solid . my two completely different brand , size and age crt monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side . user interface is merely adequate . pop up help instructions are better than many i have seen . you will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work ( the hardwired buttons on the monitor , not software ) . in order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you can use "" back "" within the calibration , sometimes you must start over . also the separate "" profile chooser "" utility software , has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier . you can see it with windows display properties , but it may not appear in the profile chooser list . dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version . yes , it does dual monitors , but with an asterisk . it will create separate profiles , but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards . if you have a single video card with dual outputs , it will load the same profile ( the last one you created ) to both monitors at startup . this quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk ( and blames windows for the problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material , catalogs , or on the box . fortunately there is a work around ( not documented ) at least with my particular video card and running xp . after windows opens , you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor . you may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default . once it 's all set up , running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure , but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles . and check it after you open the application . i 've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time ."

pos,"this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens . it covers the useful 18-35 mm range ( which is 27-52mm on a nikon digital slr , which is a very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half the price of the ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , and does almost as nice a job . sufficiently nice , in fact , that most amateurs will not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like a tank , i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent , and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros . on a nikon digital slr , which will use the center portion of this lens ( due to the size of the sensor in the slr ) you can expect excellent , even spectacular results . this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent , versatile lens . this one is great for parties , vacations , and the works . the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast , are very sharp , and have beautiful color rendition . there just is not a lot not to like about this lens . i give it 4 stars for overall performance , but 5 stars for value and price / performance . some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers . this is one of those"

neg,"if you 're looking to capture "" the decisive moment "" with the nikon coolpix 8400 , stop- --do not buy this camera ! ! ! for that matter , carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture "" action , "" because what you think you see , may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image . let me briefly explain where i 'm coming from : i made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years . by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images . i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years ( although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses ) , starting with the original nikon f slr ( which i still have ) and finishing up with the n90s and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths . i like nikon equipment a lot . i decided to begin working with digital images last year . i was attracted to the coolpix 8400 because the "" spread "" on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm- -85mm . when i worked with film i probably used my 24mm and 105mm nikkors more than any others in my bag , so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package . let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism , it is , nevertheless , a marvel of human ingenuity . for many other uses- --such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture ( put another way , things that do n't move ) , it works wonderfully well . seriously , i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature . the images can only be described as superb ( if i do say so myself ) . i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot . working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 ( which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days ) , did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter , etc. point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment . even then , i 'd sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table . of course with digital , i ( you ) do n't have to worry about any of that stuff . one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you 're good to go . alas , the shutter lag on this , and many other digital cameras made these days , is the "" downcheck "" which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with . the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image , the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second . i have taken many good pictures of people working , "" action "" shots and the like , but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose . essentially , my shooting eye ( which is pretty damned good ) had nothing to with it . it 's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun- --if he fires enough rounds , one of them is going to hit the other guy . marksmanship has nothing to do with it . same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag . if you shoot enough images , statistically you 're probably going to get a good one . but it 's not a very good way to do things . so if you 're looking to capture what henri cartier-bresson ( i 'm not sure i 've spelled his name correctly ) so artfully described as "" the decisive moment , "" look at a digital single-lens reflexes , or wait for improvements in digicams ."

neg,i never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but i love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are american country music songs . ca n't say i 'm much of a fan of american country music so was just a bit disappointed . i think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the cd . was also disappointed that danny elfman 's desperate housewives theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it . the desperate housewives theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the tv show mentioning wisteria lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds . what ligic was there in not making this a separate track ? you would then be able to memory it out on your stereo . i like listening to tv themes and i find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds . this cd is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but i guess if you 're just buying it for the theme song you 'll have to wait for some other new tv theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own . this album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show .

neg,"my title says it all - i was really disappointed with this camera , but before i get into the specifics as to why , i must mention a few things first . this was my third camera in the exilim line - prior to purchasing z850 i have owned z60 , as well as z600. both were great cameras . i mean , what 's not to like ? clean , sexy look ; easy to use ; great picture quality . but having to work for kodak in the past , i decided that i want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing , and in order to do that i needed something with a little more manual control , so i sold my z600 , and got a z850 instead . big mistake ! i ordered it directly from amazon , and it was a brand new camera . right of the bat i got a defective unit ! the problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures , especially close-ups . the shots were blurry for the most part , and the colors were a bit off as well . how is that for quality and reliability ? ! but i thought to myself , "" it 's okay , it happens "" , so i returned it back to amazon ( thanks to their great return policy ) , and got myself another one , this time from techtoysforless ( it was a lot cheaper comparing to amazon ) . one thing to be aware of - techtoysforless sells what it 's called "" grey market "" cameras . i knew about it ahead of time , but someone might not , and then be unpleasantly surprised . for those who do n't know what it is - the "" grey market "" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer . only new products fall under the legal , accepted definition of grey market . grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods . frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another . this situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment , such as cameras . entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply , often at retail but sometimes at wholesale , import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there . so , the product is legal , it 's new , and it 's cheap . but.. . in some instances , there could be minor differences between the "" authorized "" product , and the "" grey market "" one . for example , a "" grey "" z850 does n't have an ebay mode , but offers an "" auction "" mode instead . it 's a bit different with respect to settings . also , there is no full blown manual in the box , but rather a short "" how to "" instruction in various languages . however , the full manual can be found on a cd-rom . another difference , and that 's actually a plus i think , is that it comes with a european power adapter , whereas american sold models do n't have that . the biggest concern with "" grey market "" products , however , is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty , so you have to be aware of that , and check before buying . i knew all of the above , but still took a chance , mainly because the price difference was significant , but also because techtoysforless had a 10-day return policy , and i thought that it would be enough time for me to "" explore "" the camera and find out whether it 's defective or not . in any case , i placed an order , and three days later held a new z850 in my hands . i did n't waste any time , and when the battery was fully charged , i started taking shots left and right . all of them were crisp , clear , and sharp , so i knew the unit was good , and the lens was n't defective as it was with the previous one i had . however , and i noticed it right away because i tend to take mostly pictures of people , the colors were a bit "" warm "" . what i mean is there was a slight cast of "" pink "" present in all pictures . you would n't notice it in pictures of architecture , food , or nature , but people 's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural , and it was very obvious . neither z60 , nor z600 had that problem . i still kept the camera though because i could take care of it by doing some minor editing / post processing . what finally made me gave it up ( i sold it on ebay ) , was the casio 's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a "" broken "" movie mode . the original firmware , version 1.0 , that the camera came with had a problem with "" stair stepping "" - the movies were "" jerky "" , and "" noisy "" . after numerous complaints by the customers , casio released two new firmware versions , 1.1 , and 1.1b that supposedly "" fixed "" the movie issue . but what they in fact did was just "" cripple "" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1b , and the picture quality actually got worse ! version 1.1 did n't actually fix anything , but rather "" improved "" already decent picture quality , and added support for high capacity memory cards . also , i 've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning , there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality . i did n't want to wait to find out , so i got rid off it . i did n't do my usual pros and cons type of review in this case , and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera , but it actually does have a few good things . for one , in addition to its big , super-bright display , it has a viewfinder ! a big plus in my opinion , especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine . also , on top of its numerous preprogrammed best shots , it has some manual controls , giving you even more flexibility . it 's a nice little camera . unfortunately , it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability . i wish i could say that i enjoyed using it , but it was more of a hassle than fun . however , i still stand behind casio products . after i sold z850 , i got myself a p700 model , which has been discontinued for some time now , and is virtually impossible to find anywhere . it 's a semi-pro model , and offers even more manual controls than z750 / z850 models . excellent camera ! a true performer ! built like a tank , has a sharp canon lens , and made in japan for a change ! ( all other exilim models are made in china , which could be the reason for poor quality ) i 've used p700 for a couple of months , and.. . sold it : - ) yep.. . call me crazy , call me whatever you want - i just decided that i want even more manual control and flexibility , so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2. one word - wow ! what a camera ! optical image stabilization , wide angle leica lens , raw format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera . i 've had it only for 2 days now , but i 'm already in love with it . do n't forget to check my review of it , which is coming shortly . i did n't completely abandon casio 's though - my present to my wife for valentine 's day this year - casio ex-s770 in red color . i 'm definitely going to get my hands on it also , so come back for another review soon . once again , i hope i 've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions . good luck"

pos,"tim burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood . from his stop-animation work ( "" the corpse bride "" ) to dark romances ( "" edward scissorhands "" ) to horror ( "" sleepy hollow "" ) , burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there , but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension . perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl 's most famous work , "" charlie and the chocolate factory , "" and remain true to the author 's vision . most people associate the tamer , goofy "" willie wonka and the chocolate factory , "" starring gene wilder , with dahl 's tale , but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him . so it is perfect that burton makes a darker , more dangerous film for all to enjoy . the visuals in "" charlie "" are astounding . the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate ( not the icky brown water of "" willie wonka "" ) , and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design . and that is not all - oh , no , that is not all ! possibly the most visually stunning element in "" charlie "" is willie wonka himself , played by burton favorite johnny depp . depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them , and one wonders what inspired depp 's quirky , nervous , mean-spirited , selfish concoction . depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose , and he never misses a note . but whereas gene wilder 's willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster , depp 's wonka has a sadistic streak in him , perhaps instilled by his dentist father . this is a great , if much-maligned , performance . the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the oompa-loompas , wonka 's army of diminutive henchmen . in the wilder film , the oompa-loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy "" oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do "" tune . in this version , all the oompa-loompas are played by the same character ( even though there are hundreds of them ) , and their dance numbers are even more fantastic . however , the songs do n't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs , which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest . indeed , there are several lyrics that i just could n't catch in this film version , and that is a pretty major quibble . far from a feel-good movie , but definitely a good movie , "" charlie and the chocolate factory "" deserves to be seen and , for fans of artistic visions , studied ."

neg,"eugene o'neill 's play "" long day 's journey into night "" is a pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play about his family . i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater , i did not enjoy reading this play . the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read . i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion . the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends . no happy ending , no hope for the future , just despair . "" long day 's journey into night "" is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without . however , after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background , and the extent to which the play is based on his life , i began to have a greater appreciation for this play . o'neill did lead a very hard life , therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner . while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending , it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending . i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue . at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal , loving family . the audience soon however , gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right , and that the family is tense . slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members , but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up . thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well , their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth . although i still believe "" long day 's journey into night "" to be thoroughly disheartening to read , the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing ."

pos,"this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 , 000 years across the continents . diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume . the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali . yali 's question was , "" why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea , but we black people had little cargo of our own ? "" reading the book , i think i gulped at this point . this sounds like a classic , loaded question . it sounds disturbingly close to why have we ( europe and its former colonies ) succeeded where they have failed . diamond does not descend into that territory though , but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely . there are references to a culture 's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing , for instance . the advantages of a hunting / gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia . this history can probably be described ( or perhaps is most successful ) as based around environmental causation ( as opposed to the racial / ethnic / social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing ) . descriptions of climate ( note : that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age ) , longitudinal or latitudinal axes , elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity . still , it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title . guns . europe 's refinement of this technology was based on china 's innovations with gunpowder . today 's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated . as an interesting counterpoint , japan had owned more and better guns in c . 1600 ce , than any country in the world . samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology . japan would n't resume manufacture until mid 19th century . obviously , there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry 's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today . germs . epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who did n't survive . smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities . epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals ( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate ) . interesting note : the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease ( likely smallpox ) rather than guns . steel . technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities . a hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining , as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas . diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society , where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses . there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things . first , there appears to need to be sustainable farming . many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region ( where today we invade , suck oil , and force the conquered to endure freedom ) . the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop . as a complete side note , the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming . another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself . compared to africa and the americas , eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south . movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal . something like corn ( maize ) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography . llamas and guinea pigs ( which could be useful for pack animals and food ) never made it north . conversely , all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle , horses , pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe . to answer yali 's question , some of the answer is luck . africa , australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had . some other is environmental determinism , where you are helps make up who you become . for going forward , diamond cites transportation , communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future . after word : harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up , but not as fully developed here , that of pre-clovis native american discoveries ( pronouncements ) , knowingly confronting a loaded racial / ethnocentric question in a folio called "" might white of you : are american archaeologists white supremacists ? "" the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000-11000 bce . there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date , but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive . one wonders if the pre-clovis discovery ( especially all the business about "" caucusoid "" skulls ) , is n't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide ."
pos,"this is my first review for amazon . i 've always felt that the reviews that i read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that i liked . not this time . i have an extensive collection of anime . everything from the really silly stuff , filled with fan service , to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about . i 'm not really into the mecha thing , though i do have a lot of it . it 's the animation first that drives my interest , then its the story and the character development are close seconds . appleseed has all that i 'm looking for in an anime , and in spades . great characters , a well crafted plot , and some of the best animation i have ever see . to say , as some reviewers have , that the movement in this version are unnatural , is more than unfair , it 's just not true . all action is extremely lifelike , and the action scenes are the best i 've ever seen . i actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly , something i never do . i 've owned this version of appleseed a few weeks now , and i have watched it at least five times , and am looking forward to another veiwing soon . i have relied on amazon reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past , so i hope that this reveiw is helpful . there is a lot of good anime worth investing in , and this one is near the top of my list"

pos,"luc ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology . does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure ? does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question ? ferry is not the first to raise these questions . the institute for social ecology , led by murray bookchin , has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter . of course , there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology , but they do not make up the whole story . particularly glaring is ferry 's one-sided depiction of eco-feminism . in fact , some eco-feminist work in the u.s. has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism . the questions which occupy ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology , and many of his criticisms are on-target for a specific body of work . but he does n't bother to see the whole picture , and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms"

neg,"i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s . unfortunately , instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music , what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated , with some latin tones now and then . the only semi retro / electro tracks on here ( and my favorites ) are feel for you , love bite , your love is like a drug , and marc almond 's remix of venus . the two lead singles "" move in my direction "" and "" look on the floor "" are not even the strongest tracks ! and the remixes on their singles do n't make them much better . i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken , but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this . take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne ( ! ) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that do n't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just do n't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc . but of course , fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection . it 's listenable , if not up to today 's standards"

neg,"i ordered this mic after having to return the ecmhs1 ( because it was , in reality , totally non-directional ) . well , this one actually is directional , but it is such a pain to use i wish i never bought it . 1st of all , you should know this mic does not work with the "" smart shoe "" available on most sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe . therefore it is battery powered . this may seem like a minor problem , but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video , otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery . believe me , at some point you will forget this . not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it is n't in the way . ( in my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use . ) ( as you might expect , i highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible . of course , that means the mic does n't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe . it 's a great feature . ) finally , while the engineers at sony have done some amazing things over the years , they were n't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic 's battery . this cap will fall off with even the slightest touch . this can be incredibly annoying . mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed to find it . i finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it ( does n't look great , but at least the color matches ) . considering the high cost , this mic is a really bad investment . while the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic , this is a very poor substitute ."

neg,i had an s5000 but it dropped it and broke . so i decided to buy this model since i loved the s5000 so much . they took away so many of the great options and quality that the s5000 had...so now i just use a small fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf . it is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control . i would suggest going with the s5000 even with lower megapixels it is much better quality

pos,"i remember way back in ' 80 when this movie was the buzz of hollywood . that is , the buzz on johnny carson . the media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself . yet , in the mid 80 's , it came out on both betamax and vhs , and naturally i bought me a beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was . first , it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption . it is long and intraclly woven together . it is lavish and sometimes loud . it is a brutal slap in the face to "" manifest destiny "" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is "" god 's "" country . as if their ' god "" gave them wealth and privilige and that this god justifies revolution , massacre and war . many comparisons can be mase with the america of the late 19th century and the america ruled presently by king george w . and his robber barons of capitalism . but it is now , as then , much more conveniant to steer the "" common man "" into their churches , into their army , into their lies . the enemy is those "" illegal aliens "" those in the "" gay agenda , "" those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo . kris kristofferson plays a mayor / sherriff if wealth and means who ( shock-shock ) sides with the common man and the undertrodden . when another of his "" breeding and class "" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class , he replies to the creep : "" you are not of my class , to be of my class you first have to die and be born again !

neg,"when the airplane kept it tight as in ' white rabbit ' ' somebody to love ' they were a force to be reckoned with , but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed . now i happen to think that jack cassidy just about saves the band with that bass , but even he ca n't stop the monotony of ' bear melt ' and ' rock me baby ' surely the worst version i 've ever heard and this is all down to jorma kaukonen 's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing . the guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a hot tuna gig . anyone who saw the clip in woodstock will know what i mean..no wonder hendrix 's set was so eagerly awaited ! occasionally the band get it together and balin and slick 's vocals mesh together brilliant , but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate . face it when it comes down to it very few west coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say cream or ten years after . as i said casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear . it 's better than ' thirty seconds ' but then again anything is . if you think that ' happy trails ' and ' live dead ' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set , but i just think its sleep inducing"

pos,"victor hugo 's enormous output is unique in french literature.. . he was described as ' the most powerful mind of the romantic movement ' and his novel , published in 1862 , continued to be widely read.. . the plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of paris.. . its author claimed it as a ' religious ' work , and indeed by means of its characters , sometimes a little larger than life , yet always vital and engaging , and by its re-creation of the swarming parisian underworld , the main theme of man 's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life.. . hugo relives his youth in this vast novel , the culmination of 14 years work.. . he and valjean share their most outstanding characteristic : their charitable heart.. . the story contains glimpses of hugo 's disgust towards ' the treatment of the lower class french citizens by the government : valjean , an ex-convict recently released from prison , but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself ; fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child.. . and towards the ' general injustice of the law enforcement system : valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread ; fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class.. . the symbol of france 's greed that hugo despises is thenardier - the man that fantine entrusts cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making cosette his personal slave.. . the strongest emotions of "" les misérables are love and hate.. . javert and valjean are both extremes , with a conscience incredibly strict.. . liam neeson is cast as the gentle valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation.. . he changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of vigau , and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent , giving manual and financial help to the weak , sick and poor.. . after nine years , valjean was horrified to discover that javert - a former guard of the quarries of toulon , where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of vigau 's police force.. . valjean 's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire ( indirectly ) one of his workers fantine - turned prostitute.. . he assumes responsibility for raising her daughter cosette.. . he becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness.. . geoffrey rush plays the icy chief inspector javert , the man who tries "" to live his life without breaking a single rule . "" when he is given the job of spying in the barricades and valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him , things begin to fall apart for him.. . the action of mercy of jean valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence.. . he is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions.. . he sees too late the truth.. . valjean 's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud.. . he is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in paris to investigate the mayor , the man he believes is a convict.. . when he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying monsieur le maire as the ' convict ' jean valjean , he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed : "" you must punish me "" , he says , "" or my life will have been meaningless . "" ( a key line in the film ) . uma thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of fantine with admirable restraint , giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film.. . she gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character 's frustration and pain exquisitely.. . fantine 's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child.. . being in a wild state , enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery , she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers , but valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding javert 's authority.. . when valjean helps her , she begins to rediscover hope.. . her joy at the thought of having cosette with her is great.. . but the shock of valjean 's arrest and the discover that cosette is not there , are too much for the poor creature.. . claire danes plays the teenage cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful.. . she disobeys her father 's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing marius - a charismatic young parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love.. . cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the thenardier 's inn , horribly mistreated and constantly terrified.. . she grew up in a convent , innocent , pure and a bit naïve.. . peter vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered valjean around.. . bille august tries to capture the essence of hugo 's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance , keeping the eternal three elements : the bishop handing over the candlesticks ; fantine 's collapse ; marius crying out : "" to the barricades ! "" history does n't change , as voltaire once remarked.. . but what we need from it , does.. . valjean 's story is not unique , it 's universal.. . in other world , it 's contemporary.. . there are certainly enough "" les misérables "" to go all around the world.. ."

neg,"being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "" hard industry . "" i personally believe that it 's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that 's the foundation of real wealth , not legal services or newswires . so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation , give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is , and suggest ways to improve it . oh , how very , very wrong i was . . . this book started off strong , . . . for about four pages . after that a litany of tortured logic , un-sourced assertions , facts taken completely out of context except for the author 's subjectively added adjectives , orwellian double-speak , sleight of hand arguments , flat out ridiculuos statements , contradictory assessments , and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century . even a broken watch is correct twice a day though , so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating . these include : - manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry , creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs , provided it 's run right . ( a big if . ) - high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive . - americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates . - there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view , leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain . ( i.e. enron ) a scholarly , fair , and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful . this is not what you 'll get in this book though . instead you 'll get : a begining section about postindustrialism , things like the internet , information technology , financial services , etc. , the things that make the services based economy . in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates , instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument . not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men , set them on fire , and piss on the smoldering remains . this is where vitriol even comes out , where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking . if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument , they probably do n't have one . most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist . to me , this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to , oh , i do n't know , let 's say a fish . a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing . this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there 's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large . this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data , charts of gdp growth over time , pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services , manufacture , agriculture , etc. you will get none of that . there 's little value except in reassuring the obvious , high wage nations can do manufacturing . many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still do n't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though ! you also know you 're being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like "" while industry_x has certainly had its share of problems recently . . . "" at the begining of a section . a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire , free markets , and the concept of free trade . george soros and a bunch of other lefties , with pat buchanan thrown in for "" balance "" , should be listened to instead . the worst part of this book is the author 's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument . examples of twisted thinking abound : - a post-industrial "" industry "" grows five times over in a certain period . the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad . later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60% ! self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise . the author 's challenge to the reader seems to be "" who are you going to believe ? me , or your lying eyes ? "" - he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world . later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world 's workers . - the only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context . when describing service industries "" paltry "" $50 million revenues , "" only "" 60 , 000 jobs , "" disappointing "" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common . but when describing manufacturing "" a very high "" $6 million revenues , "" a good mix "" of 1 , 500 jobs , and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow . a number in and of itself means nothing . the fact the author leaves out any head on , direct comparison between industries is telling . - official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes . when the official figures do n't agree with him , he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong . when attacking his straw men though , he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner . - gems of orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "" solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity . ( pg . 184 ) "" i.e. it 's competitive where there is no competition ! and "" even in singapore , one of the freest societies in the east , the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . ( pg . 229 ) "" that 's not very free if it 's forced is it ? ( his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i 've ever read and really is worth the price of the book . he capstones it with the "" most encouraging "" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make ! - to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out . wow , what an achievement . any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it 's internal workings wear out , but whatever . . . ) - americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards . the american economy , despite the statistics , is in bad shape . the japanese instead are eight feet tall , can read people 's minds and see through lead . the japanese economy , despite the statistics , is in really great shape . this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims , and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments . the author basically ca n't get out of his own way . - he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they do n't put numbers into context , are using twisted logic , making mere assertions instead of quoting facts , etc. , apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses ! - he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's . this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper . america is n't doing that badly in aerospace by the way . the author fails to mention that 50% of the "" european "" airbus is made in america . this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient . the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions . you 'd have to buy the book to see them all because there 's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page . all in all , this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity . it 's really a mercantilist argument , and the only common thread that i could see in all the author 's cloudy reasoning is that nation 's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what . it 's not , unfortunately , a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world ."

pos,"i 've skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage , and this is by far most interesting contribution to date . first , there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book . second , the author frequently brings into the discussion a european-influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex , parenthood , gender politics , and relationship expectations . her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness , and in the course of building and sustaining security , we can frequently lose the "" me "" and "" you "" in us . but even more important , she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union - - while great for chores and child care - - can be a neutralizer in the bedroom . you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories , but you will not walk away from them empty handed , either . there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced , and wo n't survive well in the o'reilly world of broadcast media interviews . i can just hear some producer-fed talking head asking something like , "" you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging ? why ? "" ( she does n't ) . so do n't pay attention to that noise . this is an intellegent , respectful , contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum . buy one for yourself and one for your best friend - - more than likely , they 're suffering , too"

pos,"having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series , the following are my suggestions . 1. read all five books in order . the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context . think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal . dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable . getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3 , 500 page experience . 2. read the oxford university editions . there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events . when you read 3 , 500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight . the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter . 3. if you really like any one book in particular , go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection . i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir . the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable . along with sir walter scott , alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel . i have been reading these types of novels my entire life . beyond a doubt , alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre ."

neg,"history has a way of making the radical seem conservative , and certainly within the context of cecil taylor 's music , his debut album , "" jazz advance "" is rather conservative . taylor , known for his relentless , dense music , did not emerge fully formed ( although even at this early date , his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries ) , but developed over time . for those of us who enjoy taylor 's music , this record is a historical curiosity , for anyone else , its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early ornette coleman idiom ( indeed , this music is far closer to coleman 's sound than anything taylor would be doing in the ' 60s or later ) . my understanding is that when this was first released , it raised quite a stir . its a bit difficult to see why . taylor is largely melodic- - performing pieces with coherent themes- - his experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords , odd inversions , and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this point . the record is four originals and four standards , and as one would suspect , taylor largely breathes on his own compositions . he is backed by nearly inaudible bassist buell neidlinger and drummer dennis charles , with soprano sax player steve lacy on two tracks . neidlinger and charles are far closer in the hard bop idiom- - their performances swing , charles in particular is playing way inside hard bop . this puts them a bit at odds with taylor , who , while he gives more space than he would on his later work , is still more of a neoclassical improvising pianist than a jazz pianist . when lacy plays , taylor 's form of comping does n't seem fully formed , or lacy does n't seem quite prepared to play inside taylor 's environment , and as a result he sounds somewhat detached from the pianist . the sounds of the future can clearly be heard on several tracks , "" bemsha swing "" features many of taylor 's clustered chords and runs , solo piano take on "" you 'd be so nice to come home to "" presents the theme in a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future organized chaos as he 'd get , and while original "" rick kick shaw "" is far away from where he 'd end up , its the first sign of the short of aggression that taylor would harness in the future . the music is enjoyable enough , but taylor would reach such heights that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his future works . the other complaint is the sound- - this issue is from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering . in the end , this is an album of historical value . if you 're looking for an introduction to taylor 's music and are n't ready to dive head first into his methods , try "" looking ahead ! "" , its a far superior album by which point neidlinger and charles ( who reprise their roles ) were far more closely integrated with taylor 's music"

pos,"the beautiful young brooke shields plays 11 / 12 year old violet , daughter of hattie ( susan sarandon ) a new orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world . when she turns 12 , her virginity is auctioned off . brooke shields ' portrayal of violet is poignant and beautiful . her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet . the scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer 's bed ( very childlike ) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose , forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings ! i just wanted to jump into the tv and give her a hug ! ! this , mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene ( and others ) is particularly poignant as we know that young violet is merely reciting what she 's heard from the prostitutes . the photographer also says that violet does n't know what she 's saying . you just want to turn the clock back , hug violet and give her a proper childhood ! the photographer marries her because he 's fascinated with her beauty , innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute . the part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he 's trying to give back her childhood , sadly she 's been exposed to too much , too soon in her life . susan sarandon and brooke shields are wonderful in this movie as well as keith carradine , the photographer . the art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing . this movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as ' normal ' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to ' rescue ' young violet ."

pos,"first , if you 're thinking about using these photos for print , you may wish to think again . most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height , or 1-2 inches at 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than that , and they 'll start to blur and / or get jagged . also note , that if you try to export / save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting , the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size , causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate . you need to use the "" use image 's full size "" checkbox when exporting images . if you specify a 300 dpi size , and do n't use that checkbox , you 'll get a stretched image . for example , the first image in the collection ( the pocket watch ) is only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the "" use image 's full size "" box , the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide . the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and / or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project . all that said , if you 're going to use the images for the web , they 're great . you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three "" photo objects "" collections , each of which is much more expensive than this single collection . the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide , but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects ) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background ) . for the price , this is a good collection . there are lots of shots with minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but for someone trying to get something just right , that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered"

pos,"i bought this item last month from amazon.com for $149. i thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors , and not those vibration motors . when the item arrived and i setup , i found out they are using the vibration motors ! a little disappointed i am . but i use it , it is not bad if you do n't mind the vibration motors . the heat feature is great . however , the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position is n't holding well . the leather-like material really feels like a lether . the vibration really vibrates the whole floor , so i suggest to put on carpetted areas only . i personally like the hand-like massage chair better . but this $149 chair is worth the price . others would sell for over $300"

pos,"the earlier reviews pretty much said it all ; this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the 90s . swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often , however , if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band , because they are n't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock . yes , rock . who knew it could still be done , and believe me , they do it well , and uniquely . if you 've listened to swervedriver before , then tehre is n't too much more to say - buy this album . it 's not as hi-fi as 99th dream or mezcal head ( in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade ) , but not as fast or dirty as raise . now , if you have never listened to swervedriver , this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes . personally , i would suggest starting with 99th dream or mezcal head ; either way , this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album - great lyrics , superb and unique songs , and that urge for more when it 's over . sadly , this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together ( however , some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway ) . but if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so , if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - swervedriver is a must"
pos,"carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources . hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove . the plot revolves around mother paula 's pancake house , a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls . the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records . unwary citizens applaud mother paula 's in coconut cove . the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers . he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister , beatrice and new kid , roy . beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana , earning the dubious title of cowgirl . when you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you 've got a pretty good read !"

pos,"this is my all time favourite jacksons album . this album , along with ` mama ca n't buy you love ' and anything by donna summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the states as a kid . comprising mainly jackson compositions ( and production ) , it showed a more mature and funky side of the group , and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy motown works . filled with their trademark smooth harmonies , lots of horns and michael 's distinctive vocals , the album hit #11 on the billboard album charts ( #3 r&b ) , was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in ` shake your body ( down to the ground ) ' #7 pop . ` blame it on the boogie ' opened the album in style , a funky upbeat disco tune that one could n't keep still while it played . other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden ` things i do for you ' , the frenetic ` all night dancin' ' , and the shimmery ` shake your body ' with its distinctive riff , which hinted at future mj songs like ` do n't stop till you get enough ' and ` workin ' day and night' . for me however , the songs that really did it for me were the ballads . ` push me away ' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from michael , alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease . great horns ! title track ` destiny ' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where michael declares ` if it 's the rich life i do n't want it / happiness aint always material things' . great backing harmonies too . ` bless his soul ' is simply stunning ! featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what 's right , but never seeming to please anyone . ` you just ca n't please the world and yourself ' sings jackie . this song starts off tender with congas , fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of ` the life you 're living is dangerous ' and a fab outro of ` hey , ha ha ha' . then comes the final track and my favourite . the dramatic ` that 's what you get for being polite' . a thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings , and then michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love . dazzling instrumentation , a stellar vocal performance from michael , the cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros , and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers . one of my favourite childhood albums , one of my all time favourite albums , and a classic !"

pos,"alien invasion stories have been done to death since h.g. wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre . well , william c . dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise . what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is , first of all , the invading force being made up of different races . this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles , in-fighting and fight for freedom ( some are slaves to others ) make for something new , different and engaging . also , using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true , and tragic , note . the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves , close off their borders and horde resources . the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth . and , sadly , collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans . but the seeds of rebellion have been planted . humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races . all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach . i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly . dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting ."

pos,"this is a compilation , but the original incense and peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time . i will date myself now , but i remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it . it was the first lp i had ever bought . i actually wore out the groves on the lp and came across another a few years ago . to this day , almost 40 years after i first heard the strawberry alarm clock , i still like incense and peppermints as well as their other songs . their style ranges from acid rock to jazz . the musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era . their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today 's music is . sac was in an era where 60 's music was in transition from the early beatles and old time r&r sound to a more acid rock sound . lyrics like ' tune in , turn on , turn your eyes around. . look at yourself ' were typical of sac 's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times . it was an odd time . on one side , we had woodstock , mini-skirts , muscle cars and fun fun fun , but , on the dark side , there were civil rights problems and the viet nam war . this transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music . although not as popular as names like the doors , jefferson airplane and steppenwolf , the strawberry alarm clock still had a huge following . my only regret is that i did n't get a chance to see them ( or the doors ! ) when they came to the city where i lived during the late 60's . this album is a nice compilation of sac 's hits . the songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago ."

pos,"it 's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that xtc 's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70 's first wave of british punk rock . those were different times , after all . you could n't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky , spastic wit of & quot ; white music&quot ; . come to think of it , not many people could make much sense of it back then , either . andy partridge 's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than & quot ; pop&quot ; , and barry andrews ' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song . nevertheless , the album worked . it rocked in its own art-damaged way , and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation . that lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the fab four 's & quot ; hard day 's night&quot ; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to & quot ; this is pop&quot ; . a few songs later dylan 's & quot ; all along the watchtower&quot ; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia . there may have been more intense punk artifacts from the class of ' 78 , but not many were anywhere near as smart as & quot ; white music&quot ;"

pos,"i am not a photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never had a digital slr before ; the camera i had before the d50 was a nikon coolpix ( a compact one ) . i thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro . i realized that it was even better than what i expected ( maybe because i was coming from a nikon coolpix ) . the colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good . the d50 is among the cheapest digital slr 's , and , at the same time , it is a very serious product . i do n't think the d50 is much inferior to the canon rebel , even if the canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution . i used both the d50 ( which i own ) and the rebel ( at my school ) and i think the d50 feels much more like a "" pro camera "" when you hold it in your hands , while the rebel feels more like a toy . the lenses provided in the package are good , but are basic . according to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80 , but i think i should have bought the 55-200 as well : 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take . also the 18-135 that nikon sells with the d80 looks good to me , but they do n't make a kit with those lenses for the d50. the last thing that really amazes me is the .nef format ( nikon 's raw format ) . it is impressive how quickly you can improve a .nef picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse . if you want a good camera , and you do n't want to spend too much money for it i think this is the best choice"

pos,"the canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements , whether they are sand , rain , pool , or ocean . for use on the beach , while snorkeling , or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing . if you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands . these weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing . the kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing 's buoyancy . i prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by canon . i 'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use ."
pos,"some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch , dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge , an aquaduct , or the entrance to a castle . it probably was n't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room . my guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room . but as soon as one was built , i suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created , and that an artist could transform this sky into a ' vision of heaven . ' this book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth . it is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth ."
pos,"if you 've found these reviews , you already know this lens is one of the best canon products out there . i did not bite on the is version , and i have not found myself ever wishing i did ; this lens is everything it 's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light / indoor situations . i do n't think it 's weight is that big a deal . i really do n't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day - - in my hands or in a bag - - even with a 1.4 extender attached . it can feel a bit heavy but i do n't mind , and neither will you when you see the results later on . i 've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it 's landed me front page ink several times . in my mind , i could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range , which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography , considering the 300 f / 2.8 and it 's friends are much , much more expensive . the lens works basically just as fast and sharp , in my opinion , with the 1.4 at f / 4 , although some may debate this . flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro . if you can swing the price , enjoy it ! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this is one of the finest lens around . it 's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are"

neg,i bought this camera in about february 2005 but did n't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot . takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture . i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface ( loose dirt and sawdust ) and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on . contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one . so i am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp
neg,"i bought this camera for myself during christmas 2004. it was suppose to be a utility camera , ebay items and class projects for the kids only- -i do n't trust digital cameras for family photos . the kodak cx7300 seemed to fit the bill ; inexpensive , easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp . the flaw in this camera did n't appear until i pulled it out of the drawer some months later . the camera would n't turn on . i checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape . i eventually tried replacing the batteries and , sure enough , that worked . the next time i took out the camera , the exact same thing happened . and the time after that . at first , i thought the cx7300 was eating the batteries . but eventually i came to the conclusion that the camera does n't eat batteries , it nibbles at them . it wo n't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries . the kodak batteries that came with the cx7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight , going strong . i contacted kodak about this flaw . they wanted to talk about what kind of batteries i 'm using- -kodak- -or the option of my purchasing a camera dock and some rechargeable batteries . a solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent . i thought that buying an optional ac adapter would be the simple , and cheap , solution . surprise , surprise , the cx7300 is one of the few digital cameras kodak makes that does n't take one . so , now that i 'm way past warranty , what do i do with it ? i 'm shopping for another camera"

"" i do n't know about the comment from the reviewers below about "" mi banda toca rock "" as menudo song ( a horrible thought to some of us ! ) , but the original italian version was fun . it 's not a bubblegum song , but about the combination of traditional latin music ( latin in the original sense , all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers ) and rock music , something that was starting to happen when the song was written . this reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in english . i believe they are wrong about the song . "" estrella gemela "" has some sections in english , but that is the way it was originally written and performed by eros ramazzotti ( in italian and spanish ) , to emphasize the influence of african-american gospel music in the song . laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song . all in all , this is a great album , so give it a shot . whether you speak the language or not , the italian version of the album is even better . laura just keeps getting better with time ! laura sei bravissima"
pos,"while i thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie , this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies . all have their funny moments . i still enjoy the first the best . mainly because the jokes were original and fresh . though it is still funny to see the strange things jim would get himself into . levy as his father was a great choice . this is worth the 20 dollars easy . lots of laughs , and plenty of gross out humor"

neg,"i watched this with some trepidation , and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be . it was better because it remained fairly true to the original , in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending . it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original , and i found stone 's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting . a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd . one was the london setting , which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns . the other was sharon stone 's rather plucky performance , and the presence of charlotte rampling , who has aged into a different kind of beauty . morrisey does n't even come close to filling michael douglas 's shoes , and it 's hard to feel sorry for him at the end . as with the first movie , you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made . the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one . however , both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex . there 's nothing wrong with either of these things , but here they just get in the way"

pos,"barbershop is a rare event in african-american filmmaking . it 's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for african-americans . i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the african-american community is ; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen . i really liked this movie . we definitely need more films like this calvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father . mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes , calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life . it 's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood . there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they 're all easy to follow . one follows a stolen atm machine , one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant , another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend , another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview , and yet another follows a white barber 's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with . in a way , this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories . each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop . director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop . i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop . watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy . it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flat-top trimmed ( both are closed now . ) : ( there are a ton of great performances in this movie ; i 'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people . ice cube is great as calvin . i liked his performance here . michael ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber . ealy makes you feel his characters ' desperation . cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber . he 's funny and poignant . sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college . anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it . watching them try to open will make you laugh . keith david is creepy as the loan shark . then again , keith david is always good in anything he does . i 'd pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages . i do n't know why movie critics and the rev . jesse jackson denounced barbershop , it 's one of the best movies ever made about african-american life . looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman , african-americans actually want more films like this . as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community , not just one small part of it . i for one and tired of the "" hood "" movies like never die alone , and critically acclaimed movies like monster 's ball and hustle & flow that depict black life as something negative . ( thankfully , it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too , the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up . ) end of rant , back to the review . a shawn james essential five star video . you must buy this movie . get some friends together put the dvd in the machine , pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop ."

pos,"for its time and price ( at the time ) , a fantastic camera . 6.3 mp is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , and this camera works very well with what really matters : canon 's fantastic lenses . battery life on this camera is very good . the "" shutter lag "" ( between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo ) is fairly well non-existent , and the only real lag i have is when i am shooting multiple photos in raw format . as most photographers know , the lens is almost more important than the body , and outside of leica lenses , i do n't think anything really competes with canon 's line . the 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...i used it at the beach , and on hikes with my dog , when i do n't want to lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but for $75 or so , you can have a 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which will supplement the 18-55 nicely , particularly for night photography . my one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings . when i shoot raw this is n't such a big problem , because i can fix it in photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess with the white balance every time , has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots , and then is annoying after . i think the more advanced eos models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , and also help a bit with the lag between the raw shots...but for the money , this camera is excellent , and far , far superior to , for example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( for a similar price ) . the difference , as far as i 'm concerned , is in the absolute advantage canon has in lens quality . you can use a high-end consumer body like this one , use a professional piece of canon glass ( lens ) and take excellent photos . i would n't invest in a system that does n't also boast excellent lens quality"
pos,""" the talons of weng chiang "" is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood , atmosphere , and an unusual amount of violence for "" doctor who "" - -almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out . but it 's not all gloom and doom . this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old "" doctor who "" humor at its funniest as well as thrilling "" doctor who "" adventure at its most gruesome . the dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation , madness , and serial murder ( technologically refined cannibalism , really ) , and yet the doctor 's many clever quips and leela 's naively astute observations on "" civilized "" victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout , and the main villain 's second-hand man , li-hsen chang , has some incredibly witty one-liners as well . li-hsen chang himself is a fascinating character , delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to "" weng-chiang , "" a stranded , time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he 's a deity from the taoist pantheon . chang 's paranormal powers , foremost of which is hypnotism , definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism ( see the poster advertising his show ) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction , and yet he 's also a tragic figure in many ways- -a healthy , innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man- -uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his "" god "" and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process . in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion-style educational program the doctor 's putting leela through , to her annoyance . if li-hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though , the same ca n't really be said for his master , weng-chiang himself . he 's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain , i 'm afraid , complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting . perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect , but if so , they overdid it just a bit . at times too he 's just more annoying than frightening- -every time the ever loyal li-hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor , weng-chiang throws a fit , savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum . on this score , weng-chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one 's workplace . it does n't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he 's presumably impersonating , so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing . all in all , though , this is an enjoyable adventure . the doctor is at his sleuthing best , leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior , and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion , all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting . and anyway , li-hsen more than makes up for weng-chiang 's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show , while the cyborg assassin mr. sin is genuinely creepy ( especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls ) . so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt- -or a dash of soy sauce , rather"

neg,"this book should get 0 stars ; speaking as an artist myself , the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous . the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics , etc. to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master , and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse . admittedly , i could not even finish this book ; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky , circumstantial evidence like "" all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw , but there are no correction marks , therefore optics must have been used , "" i could not even stand to keep reading ! on the contrary , all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult , after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature , and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction . that is just one example.. . the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - hockney claiming "" this is too good to have been done without optics "" or "" this was too difficult to have been done without optics "" - and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art , if that is indeed what he thinks . and , modern artists must remember this : nowadays , the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists , for many reasons . superior art education is very hard to find , and there are many distractions in the modern world ( tv , computers , having to hold a ' day job ' , lack of patrons , etc. ) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did . therefore , most will never attain the skill of the old masters . but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology ! some of the other examples used as ' evidence ' refer to ' odd ' proportion , perspective , etc. in otherwise masterful work . i am surprised that this author ( and those readers who are artists ) apparently does not realize that throughout history , great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism - even nowadays , photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists , because after all we are artists not cameras ! the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality , not to copy it ! therefore , many inconsistencies in proportion , perspective , etc. evident in old masters ' work are not ' oddities ' or ' mistakes ' , but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition . all that being said , i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist , since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of ' trickery ' or technology of some sort . instead , an art student should be encouraged to build skill , discipline , and self-reliance - because that is the true secret of the great masters"

neg,"after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) ."
pos,"i assume the plot of this famous tale is well known , so i wo n't spend time on it , but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade english class in the ' 90 's , i was repeatedly struck by a piercing question : how exactly over time does drama become melodrama ? will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence ? how does this happen , and is there ever an end-point to it ? dickens was by any standard a literary master , and if typifying one 's age is a virtue , then he does this to perfection , yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time ( as other writers have done ) is a limitation , then in this one sense alone charles dickens has an achilles heel"

pos,"never in my life have i seen a film dedicated to the subject of vichy france . i had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government . i assumed that the sorrow and the pity was strictly a documentary about the french resistance , but was pleasantly surprised by its depth . it describes the vichy of petain and laval quite thoroughly . you may recognize some of ophuls ' interviewees from the world at war ( such as edward spears ) , but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss . i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit . frankly , i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face . his point that the slaughter of 1 , 600 french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered . it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england- -given the competition- -but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after "" the rout "" of may 1940. the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists . it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain ( at first ) and looked sympathetically to the nazis . the speeches , the newsreels , and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting - especially if you 're a history buff . i 'd rank this one right up there with hotel terminus ."

pos,"there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece- -even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind , it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work . gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care . he worked on the novel for nearly six years , during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times , often spending days perfecting a single paragraph . the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty . madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine , emma bovary , as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth . she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle . flaubert 's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal . in perfect contrast to emma , flaubert introduces charles bovary , a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer . soon after their wedding , emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude . flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding , unimpressive , and unnoticed middle-class man . flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy , well-mannered , and well-liked young man-next-door , leon . with a slow-blossoming relationship with emma , leon leaves for paris to study law . upon his return- -and with a little experience- -the two become lovers . flaubert 's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore . thereafter , the degeneracy of emma 's lifestyle is evident , and she is brought to the brink of destruction . in madame bovary , gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in france during the mid-nineteenth-century . flaubert 's descriptions are detailed and beautiful- -and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing . opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century"

neg,"alright , for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals , or lacking in substance , i say this : who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are ? who is rand to say what substance is ? you 've got to look at her bias , first . realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom . as if outside factors never matter ; and maybe they do n't , for her . maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today . but i doubt it . though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live , outside influences do affect a person . but she doesn't . thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap . all books that are not driven solely by the individual 's sense of reason : do n't read , cause it will lessen your iq . any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does n't find worthwhile or cannot understand , she condemns . rand , at least as portrayed in what i 've read of her work , is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants . and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes . they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality , they are either good or worthless . the pieces of art she says are empty are empty , absolutely . they do n't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer . nothing to offer her , that is . how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history 's best books , telling other people ( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual ) what they should read ? truthfully any criticism in this form , like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world , is elitist crap trying to close people 's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others . they have their bias like anyone else . i say read in variety . observe art outside of rand 's choice of art . take in all you can , with an open mind , then start pondering whether you agree or not . if you then agree because you agree , then i say great . its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address . she says question society , but by my line of inquiry . she says be an individual , but only i know the basis of who you want to be"

pos,"first published in 1936 , this is the 12th poirot book , the 3rd superintendent battle book , and the 2nd colonel race book , and has no narrator . it 's the first case in which superintendent battle , mrs. oliver , or col . race appear together with poirot or each other , and the only case in which *all* do so at once . the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes , where poirot encounters mr. shaitana , a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip . shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose , which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he 's a victim waiting to happen . for shaitana , like a few other collectors in christie 's universe , has succumbed to a foolish temptation , and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius , but murderers . and being a connoisseur , he collects only the best : those who have gotten away with it . he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby , without naming names , and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of "" tigers "" ( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger , but would do so from outside the tiger 's cage , having respect for the danger . ) poirot accepts the supper invitation , however , to find that there are seven other guests , including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers : explorer major despard , a strong silent type ; mrs. lorrimer , a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge ; timid young anne meredith ; and dr. roberts , a loud and jovial general practitioner . shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder , but otherwise the subject does not come up , and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead , stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players ! this is , of course , poirot 's fantasy case , as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another . there are only the people themselves , and their memories of the evening , and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed . solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved . but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they 'd committed and gotten away with ? rather than following poirot 's viewpoint in third person throughout , some chapters follow battle , race , or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case . each represents a different style : battle is a professional police officer , race an empire-builder-type secret agent , and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories . battle , of course , has a duty to investigate shaitana 's murder , and does so in an orthodox style , cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him . race deals with checking out major despard , the explorer who 's most clearly his kind of person . mrs. oliver , for her part , works on worming information out of not only anne meredith , but her roommate rhonda ( whose attitude is that anne could 've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she 'd been paying attention ) . and , of course , there 's poirot . he 's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn , pursuing two major lines of questioning : ( 1 ) describe how the bridge games played out , and ( 2 ) describe the scene of the murder ( the elaborate collector 's room in shaitana 's house where the bridge games were played ) . see if you can figure out where poirot 's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues , and what he learned from the responses he received"

pos,"a quick search in amazon books under the name "" benjamin franklin "" comes up with 2403 matches . based upon that criteria , many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about ben franklin has been said . those people would be emphatically wrong , as has been proven by author and historian h.w. brands in his work on franklin , the first american : the life and times of benjamin franklin . brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in american history , back to life , once more , in this book which was a pulitzer finalist in 2002. this book is not only about franklin , but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters . brands brings the friends and acquaintances of franklin to life , ranging from cotton mather to sir isaac newton . the book also spans the life of franklin from his humble beginnings in boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of american society and government . i believe this is the finest biography written on franklin since van doren 's pulitzer prize winner of some seventy years ago . of course , a book about franklin would be incomplete without also being about the creation and formation of america , as the two are intricately attached . but brands ' work here is all inclusive , giving us not only the politics of franklin , but his creative genius , business sense and so much more we 've grown to appreciate about this senior statesman in american history . i have no idea how many biographies i have read about benjamin franklin , but this is definitely one of the best ever . h.w. brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative , meticulous detail and is one of the few franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to franklin 's human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status . monty rainey www.juntosociety.co"
neg,"first off , many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....i cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the two that were sent to me were broken ! i ordered well before christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from santa claus . my husband opened the telescope up late christmas eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken . the 2 mounting screws were bent , very bent . this puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child . after a whole lot of effort with amazon 's customer service ( from another country ! ) they sent a replacement...to the wrong address ! !

neg,"more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas . the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i would n't make that connection having read a few of faulkner 's works . sturgeon uses many of faulkner 's narrative trademarks ( i.e. streaming conscious , first person perspective of low iq individuals , disorienting changes in first person narrative ) but i did n't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying . i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously . this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books . more than human is slow , dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others . so the idea might of been original in the 50 's but topics like telekenesis , esp , computer-brain babies , and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before ( asimov ) and since . this book rarely set off that wow ! button in my head or kept me turning pages . this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best . in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book ( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 ) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting ( in this example ) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society ca n't really be ignored . besides more than human , the far superior the caves of steel , childhood 's end , and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi . needless to say , more than human did not win ( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so ) bottom line : i wanted to like this book and it does n't surprise me that others give it such high praise . these are probably people that do n't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests"

neg,"i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert 's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks . admittedly , i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball . so i 'm nostalgic , "" it 's a free country . "" it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels . yet , whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "" matured , "" i can do nothing but cringe . here 's the flowchart : band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub . - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets "" coached "" in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new "" mature "" album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process . gee , i sure hope this is n't how the end of br5-49 comes about , but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion . this record is ok . of course , i realize that any band ca n't just re-hash the same ' ol stuff on every album , but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl . one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals , and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings . this band live used to be a wild , jittery , moving organism on stage , and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at poor david 's pub in dallas ) , something has settled down . chuck is a great talent , but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett . ok , i 'll go cry me a river , but dammit , just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time . mature ? i just do n't want to grow up that bad"

neg,"firstly , let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature . his data sources are vast and highly informative . the major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased . lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view . as a result , major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over . lardy 's view is the typical western , dare i say & quot ; american&quot ; argument . primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china 's state banks . this methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the context of china 's trannsitional economy . financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency . if anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me . in summary , lardy 's book is informative and makes for interesting reading . however as a piece of economic analysis , its usefulness is limited . the major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory ( as indicated by the previous reviewer ) which has resulted in a poor methodology"

neg,"this could have been one of the best films of the 80's . all of the components are there . ford gives the best acting of his career . the production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today 's standards . two things however really bring this movie down . the major negative here i believe is polanski 's insistence on starring emmanuelle seigner . this is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen grace a film , but it is the understatement of the year to say that she ca n't act at all . in fact , i think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance i have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys ford 's performance . when the film was over i thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here . the first half is dynamite ; the second with seigner is a totally different beast , your average stupid kid thriller . watch this film and dare contradict my statement here . get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part . it 's so bad that ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in . ok , the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up . there is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where ford and seigner would be time and time again . it really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot . they were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story . i am really kind of mad with polanski here . he destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made . and this statement comes from one who worships the ground polanski walks on ."

pos,"adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to cs . if you are a quarkxpress user , you 'll find that in indesign cs2 , you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner . the tools and tool palettes are where you 'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen . small touches like being able to save your workspace , like you can do in photoshop cs2 , are great . i tested the integration between indesign cs2 and some of its counterparts in the adobe creative suite premium . i created different graphics in photoshop cs2 and illustrator cs2 and i found it was really easy to import them into indesign cs2 and use . you can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in indesign cs2. no need to go to another program . with the control palette you can also resize objects too . this palette functions with transform and stroke features for graphics , and it includes paragraph , character and table features for text editing . what the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text . i imported some formatted text in from microsoft word 2003 and two different tables in from microsoft excel 2003. i was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from microsoft excel . the tables imported easily . with indesign cs2 , you can now automatically style microsoft word files on import by mapping word styles to indesign cs2 styles as well . an issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with indesign cs2. now , adobe "" bridges "" that gap . bridge now comes as a part of indesign cs2 and the premium suite . so , viewing any adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do . using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well . adobe bridge is a standalone program . being a web designer and using adobe ( formerly macromedia ) dreamweaver 8 , i was familiar with using snippets . these are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else . now , indesign cs2 offers this snippet capability . you can export objects as snippets . these objects can be shared or reused in other documents . simply place or drag a snippet into a layout , and indesign re-creates the original objects , their formatting , and their relative positioning on the page . no more wasted time redesigning , just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit . indesign cs2 also now has an info palette that is just like those found in photoshop and illustrator . size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the info palette . this is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area . it 's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working . sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work , you have to move objects . when this happens , your structure can often change in different ways . indesign cs2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts , pull quotes , margin notes , and graphics to text . you can now precisely control the positioning of anchored objects , apply text wrap settings , and more . as with other adobe products , it is very easy to export your finished work in pdf format . indesign cs2 works so well at exporting to pdf , it even maintains the layers in acrobat 7. you can pre-define your acrobat export settings as well . indesign cs2 also supports specialty pdf formats like pdf / x-1a and pdf / x-3 , which are used in workflows . it also supports high-resolution cmyk output and color-managed workflows . if you are familiar with previous versions of indesign , the upgrade to the new version is easy . indesign cs2 is even backwards compatible cs . you will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased . loren elks , group manager d-mag.or"
neg,"i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera . it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature . it is quite compact and has a nice screen . the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here 's the bad stuff : 1 ) in the first shipment i got , the normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) did n't work . the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable . the ultra-wide images were fine . i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange . the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me . so , i do n't think it is just a random problem . there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem . my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2 ) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel . you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle . also , since you have to charge the battery in the camera , you ca n't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other . for comparison , my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger . so , if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare . 3 ) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg . while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime , it is not supported by my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) and is difficult to work with in the video editor / dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i ca n't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg , but that format created problems for me . so , i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital . but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations"

pos,"a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator 's outline of the structure of that book . a good outline can greatly enhance one 's understanding of a biblical book , so such outlines are important . rarely , though , do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived . this book , which is based on professor lee 's doctoral dissertation , describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text . this method , called "" conceptual analysis "" , is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee 's advisor , rolf knierim . lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process , where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes . one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text . finally , the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed . lee demonstrates the method on num . 10:11-36:13 , a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways . he divides this section into 36 units , discussing with each one the rationale for his choices . he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num . 13:1-14:45 , the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts , the largely negative report the scouts present to the people , and israel 's subsequent rejection of god 's plan to bring them into the promised land . the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section . conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a "" scientific "" process , with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text . there is no way to completely mechanize such a process , however . some subjectivity is inevitable , and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others . in my opinion , one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text . by this criterion , i believe that lee 's outline of num . 10:11-36:13 earns high marks . his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text , as he explains in the latter stages of the book . it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists . this book is a notable exception , and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers ."

pos,"eddie and rose are meant to be in nicole savoca 's "" dogfight . "" this is a warm and wonderful movie ; those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can . it 's sad that so few people have heard of or seen dogfight . how a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me . many others have synopsized the story , so i wont be repetitive . i will say that this movie 's genius is in its acting . river phoenix and lili taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends , and it shows in scene after scene . river gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse , absurdly young "" jarhead , "" eddie , about to ship out to vietnam . his coming of age is the narrative behind this movie , while rose 's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the "" dogfight "" make her character angelic . the poignancy of the closing scene , in which eddie embraces rose , in tears , after having lost his three best friends during the vietnam war will stay with you for a long time . dogfight is a unique and touching film . it harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as "" romantic "" by hollywood today ."

neg,"i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 "" photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my "" ideal "" photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within / between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third , i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock / timer . no ability to play stills / video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock / timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos ."

( i did get mine at around $370 at j&r , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $70 to $75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people.. . another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites ."

pos,"this thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 buster keaton movies , 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period , and the feature seven chances , show a wide range of comedy styles , from slapstick , to more refined visual humor , to what we would today call situation comedy , where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters . the earliest in the collection , "" neighbors "" from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set , although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor . here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle . the backyard love affair , for example , that opens the film resembles arbuckle 's 1915 classic "" fatty 's plucky pup "" . in neighbors there is more story , revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents , and the eventual need for the couple to elope . there is sweetness , youthful energy , and innocence in the entire movie , as well as great acrobatics , including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men . the balloonatic ( 1923 ) , near the end of the period in which buster was making short films , is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film . there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl . keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props , and this film is full of them . still , for once keaton seems uninspired , perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story . the feature in the set , seven chances , from 1925 , is based on a single theme : buster , the rich boy down on his luck , must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars . this absurd premise induces , for much of the film , a hal roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual , acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton , as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers . the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments , but may not satisfy all of buster 's fans . the climax , however , returns us to tried and true keaton formula : the lone man being chased by a thundering herd , in this case , of angry women in full wedding apparel , fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster 's colleague unbeknownst to buster . the chase has satisfying moments , including buster dodging large bolders . although worth seeing , the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature . the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton 's genius ."

neg,"gerd ludemann writes , "" historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax "" , ( 190 ) . a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support . three streams of thought permeate "" the resurrection of christ "" : gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish , invent , or explain away ; peter and paul experienced hallucination and "" vision "" experiences proceeding from self-deception ; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific . each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions , or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-christian polemic . in his chapter "" translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection "" , ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles "" purpose and tradition reworked "" ( re . gospel writers ) , and "" historical elements "" . in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic , or perhaps ( he intimates ) to cover up some element of embarrassment . for example , ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council ( which condemned jesus ) , but that mark ( earliest gospel ) "" likely "" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus . but ludemann needs to discredit such notions , for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb . ludemann 's case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances . ludemann gets carried away with himself when he , in tabloid fashion , suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to "" disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial "" of jesus . this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze . ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew , mark and luke of being anti-jewish ! ( refer to the ridiculous appendix 3 ) . is christianity a "" history of self deception "" ? ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination ; for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament . that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid . ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence . 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus ' multiple appearances . even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text ( vs. 3-5 ) to the early 30 's ad . the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection , three physical events . also , the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination , as well as being hugged ! ludemann though , convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above , and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions , introduces hallucination . what accounts for these hallucinations ? "" peter 's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning "" ( 165 ) . paul 's "" event had a character of light and , like the vision of john , happened in the spirit , i.e. , in ecstasy "" ( 47 ) . but paul does not report "" i was in the spirit "" as john does ( see revelation 1 ) . john is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience . paul is not . when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual "" in the spirit "" experience , he does so in terms appropriate to that experience ( 2 corinthians 12:2 ) . so we have record of paul 's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual . ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages "" modern depth psychology "" to explain paul 's conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to "" apostle-in-chief of a new program of salvation "" ( 170-171 ) . so , we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul 's subconscious state , than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death , burial , empty tomb and appearances ! ludemann 's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural . historians look for the best explanation of the evidence . yet ludemann writes , "" who decides at what point of historical study a ` theological explanation ' ought to begin "" ( 201 ) . this is rife with misunderstanding . one need only confirm that an event occurred in history , regardless of theological implications . also , simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism ( thus supernaturalism ) is an entirely logical proposition . yet ludemann quotes another author , "" [the disciples] believed in phantoms ; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles ; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time . "" ( 175 ) . this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus ' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened , and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works . even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle ! ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection , we should abandon christianity . sadly , he reaches the wrong conclusion . self deluded by a proliferation of "" one can imagine "" , "" seems to indicate "" , "" likely enough "" , and "" one thus suspects "" reasoning , ludemann boasts "" accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision "" . ( 210 ) . may the reader decide otherwise"

pos,"just today i randomly selected a movie , that movie was "" henry "" . i had never heard of it before , and i figured that i was in for your average , run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick . though it is low budget , it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie . in fact , the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study . meet henry , a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition . watch as he goes to work , watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis , and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people . this film does not exploit the violence though ; it is very frank and direct , treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park . this movie is a lot of things , and when it was all over , i just had to sit back and take a few breaths , have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction ( s ) . i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing , it is also pretty funny in some parts , though only funny in the blackest sense of the term . there is no social commentary in this movie , nor does it provide any closure . the dvd is great , awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas , awaiting lethal injection on death row . very fascinating"

pos,"i 've been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting . well , he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting , if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson , a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row . i wo n't go into the details of williamson 's ordeal , but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book , that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers , but is still interesting nonetheless . he does a good job giving the details of ron 's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues . grisham did n't even think about writing ron 's story until after ron passed away , so there are no interviews to draw upon , but he does a decent job of tying it all together . i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty , he does n't hammer that opinion at you . he lets the story itself do the talking . i 'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham 's next novel , as he 'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time . hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like "" the firm "" or "" a time to kill "" , not dreck like "" the king of torts """

pos,"one good knight ( 2006 ) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series , following the fairy godmother . in the previous volume , alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician . after the death of the katschei , alexander and elena were wedded , becoming godmother and consort . then an order of champions was established at glass mountain , with alexander as their master , and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms . in this novel , princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old , but is still considered a child by her mother , queen cassiopeia , and chief advisor solon adacritus . she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor . after that , her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing , appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry , and assigns a steward to handle her affairs . andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother . she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms . her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard . she reports this matter to her mother . afterward , andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature . as it comes toward her , she recognizes that it is a dragon . then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon . it flames some high architectural features , grabs a couple of animals and flies away . the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen 's advisors is very lively . andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons - - consisting mainly of myths and legends - - and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens . the ensuing discussion is even livelier , mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices . queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery . after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down , a lottery is organized . some women find ways to disqualify themselves , but others are taken by the dragon . rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice . but then andromeda is selected . this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms . andromeda 's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest . the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon , but the good knight does n't come forward as expected . someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors . however , andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site . andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance . they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown , stopping for supplies here and there , and finally enter the wyrding lands . they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother . then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems . andromeda is nineteen and naive . then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues : does her mother love her . while many events occur in this plot , this one issue is the crux of the story . even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern . highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure , betrayal and romance . -arthur w . jordi"

neg,i was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review . the cueing stinks and is frustrating . i am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using firm tapes on and off for about 15 years . this one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing . stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is so frustrating . you want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor 's mind and falling all over the bench !

neg,"a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball & quot ; nuts&quot ; who grew up in new york . we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny & quot ; wonder five&quot ; who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 ( it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled ) . this book is a fictional addendum to rosen 's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball & quot ; scandals&quot ; , as he outlines in his npr interview . unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors - - broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan ; madison square garden has been on 23rd street , and is now above penn station ; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues . these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college , and they undermine the author 's credibility and care in writing . since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence , the game of who is this really is inescapable . hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers , and & quot ; a couple are in the hall of fame . &quot ; this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy ( holy cross , ' 49 ) , dick mcguire ( st. johns , ' 48 ) , bobby wanzer ( seton hall , ' 46 ) , and frank mcguire , the legendary coach at st. john 's , north carolina and south carolina"
pos,"the music here frequently reminded me of pagan 's mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden . a fantastic mixture of 1970s progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european-style power metal and brazilian folk music . while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that do n't quite mesh . in actuality i give the cd 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired , sometimes flawed ambition . but as an overall package , this special edition of "" temple of shadows "" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog . this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums ( not to mention it 's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves , smiling throughout the show ) . highly recommended ."

neg,"i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review . it 's lightweight but sturdy , easy to assemble and disassemble , and very adjustable . i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted , like a short tripod , and it was wonderful . it 's also nicely finished , and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs , it stays together and does n't flop around while you 're toting it . unfortunately , that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder , and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder , i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera ! to my great relief , i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble , but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes . i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod , so this is not "" consumer error .

pos,"i 've always written how the american now compilations do not even come close to the british ones , and my opinion has not since changed . now 20 's track list , however , is solid and pretty good for the american series . it has mostly good rap songs ( which can be sometimes rare in this series ) , great rock songs , and not an overload of mediocrities . i 'll go in depth . 1. missy elliott feat . ciara & fatman scoop - lose control...a a great rap song - missy elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable . ciara is a nice addition to the song . fatman scoop 's random screaming in the background was n't essential , but it at least adds some energy to the track . the music 's actually interesting and something different from everything else . 2. black eyed peas - do n't phunk with my heart...c+ their first album was stellar , and their second is as well . but this was one of the worst tracks on "" monkey business "" and did not deserve to become a single . annoying , but not horrible . 3. pussycat dolls feat . busta rhymes - do n't cha...a - a really good rap song - busta 's rapping is a good addition to the song , making this radio remix better than the original on the pussycat dolls ' album , "" pcd "" . a dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade . 4. rihanna - pon de replay...b+ pretty catchy , and a good party song . but it gets pretty irritating after a while . and the "" dip it low and you pick it up slow "" from the first verse directly copies from christina milian 's "" dip it low "" . that 's so unoriginal , rihanna ! 5. ludacris feat . bobby valentino - pimpin ' all over the world...b good music , but it 's not much without the video , which was , by the way , partly shot in africa . 6. bow wow feat . ciara - like you...b bow wow 's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded , but ciara 's chorus makes this song better than mediocre . 7. dem franchize boys feat . jermaine dupri , da brat & bow wow - i think they like me ( remix ) ...c this song does not deserve the publicity , and i 'm stunned why people like this . it 's worse than mediocre , it 's horribly irritating . and much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty . rap just is n't rap when it 's edited , and this song is proof . but even without the editing i do n't think this song has a chance . annoying "" yep "" s in the background and mediocre rapping...just skip it already . 8. destiny 's child - cater 2u...b - mediocre for destiny 's child . actually pretty boring . but they have great voices . 9. lyfe jennings - must be nice...c+ mediocre . 10. natasha bedingfield - these words...a a great "" new "" artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the us . great songwriting about bad songwriting ( if that makes any sense at all ) and a good voice . now i 'm just wondering when her brother daniel 's going to release another "" if you 're not the one "" . 11. kelly clarkson - behind these hazel eyes...a - the only american idol who earned over twenty minutes of success , kelly 's finding massive success with her second album , and for a reason - she 's got an awesome voice , and pulls off rock quite well . this song was brutally murdered by the radio , but that 's why i 've moved onto the remixes ( not on this album ) . 12. d.h.t. - listen to your heart ( unplugged version ) ...a though furios f.ez 's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version , this amazing cover of the roxette track deserved all the fame it got . edmee 's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her . beautiful song also . 13. backstreet boys - just want you to know...a - the backstreet boys ' newest album must have been the #1 most unwanted comeback of all time ( let 's just hope n*sync does n't follow...*cringe* justin timberlake ) , but this is their best song . and this comes from someone hard to impress by the backstreet boys , but they pull off this rock song pretty well . 14. click 5 - just the girl...a a really good rock song which many can relate to . 15. franz ferdinand - do you want to...b atonal , but franz ferdinand has a good reputation , so i 'll let it slide . but this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump . 16. weezer - beverly hills...a+ unfortunately it was flattened , torn apart , and buried alive by the radios , so i will review it as it was still last summer when i first heard it . this song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe . but i do n't need to write this , as most people already know . 17. fall out boy - sugar we 're going down...a an amazing song , but it 's only good if you can put up with songs where you ca n't understand what they 're saying . seriously , it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what 's being said here . but the music is great , and this song overall is a pretty good rock track . 18. lifehouse - you & me...a - an instant classic . 19. coldplay - fix you...a+ i 've read mixed reviews about this song , but personally , i think its amazing . following a vaguely similar buildup as led zeppelin 's "" stairway to heaven "" , this song just keeps you listening until the end . the rockout part at the end is magical . 20. keith urban - you 'll think of me...b it 's somewhat annoying that keith 's been on now albums consistently for a while but his songs are n't as popular as , say , gretchen wilson . i 'm starting to think keith 's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there . a good song , but it could 've been replaced with something better in the country department . so overall , this is a great selection of songs , some amazing , some decent , and some mediocre to bad . i 'd suggest you buy this , as it 's a good list of tracks . overall , this album gets a b+."

( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram ."
neg,"this effort shows it 's age . in addition , there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele . i suppose it 's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology . however , i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing"

pos,"has there ever been anyone like richard nixon ? for sheer resiliency , he stands alone in american history . no one won bigger than richard nixon . and no one lost bigger than richard nixon . and then won again . and then lost . and won again . he just kept punching and planning and working , to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th century . the author of 9 books , 8 of them best-sellers , this is his first , and covers six major crises of his political life to 1962. this is serious history , but so well-written that it reads like an exciting novel . in it , you can see the raw steel of the man emerging through his discipline , beginnig with his first crisis as a 35-year-old freshman congressman , the prosecution of alger hiss , the darling of east coast liberals and the state department , as a soviet spy. . the other crises have been well-described by other reviewers , but all were thrilling examples of courage ( backed by preparation ) under fire . highly-experienced washington veteran david gergen , who worked closely with four presidents , in his excellent book "" eyewitness to history "" described richard nixon as "" the toughest man i ever knew "" . in this book , you can see why . interestingly , his overwhelming love of country shines through as well . for example , the 1960 election was unbelievably close.a swing of only 11 , 000 votes properly distributed , and the election results would have been reversed . and there was verifiable vote fraud by the democrats , especially in texas and illinois . nixon was repeatedly urged to demand an investigation and recount . he refused . first , it would have greatly delayed the transference of responsiblity to a new administration . but secondly , as he wrote , "" then , too , the bitterness that would be engendered by such a maneuver on my part would , in my opinion , have done incalculable and lasting damage throughout the country .

pos,"in america is a near perfect movie dealing w / grief and learning to live again after tragedy . it is also about hope . the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way . they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w / in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs . the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks . besides , a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child 's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life . i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons . if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see . if for nothing else than the performances of "" mateo "" and young "" kristie .

neg,"i like evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs , and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the stephanie plum and joe morelli relationship , sustained through 12 books so far , being a case in point . but full scoop was actually a trial to get through . i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich 's comedic rhythm . the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich . the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent , leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened ? the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack . none at all . so it 's hard to label the book : a sort of but not really romance , an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger... . maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller"

pos,"this product was nothing short of miraculous for me . i 'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since i hit my teens...and while i have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea ( which started about age 40 ) , including retin a cream , topical and systemic antibiotics , and every sort of over the counter cleanser , these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as i aged . i 've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it 's been in many years....i had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it . caution - i 've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity . people who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably wo n't have the same kind of experience i do . bp creams have always helped , but were not as effective as this mask , which really gets down in the pores . i use it heavily . i apply it either before i brush my teeth or before i get in the shower . it is cool and refreshing . i usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before i rinse off , although sometimes i use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after i 've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke . it leaves my skin very , very clean , and *soft.* i have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed , my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time . the dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me . it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin . working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty , dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out . now before cleaning or working i will actually put a bit of this mask on - wne i am done , my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity.. . i stay clear and smooth . i guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria . i do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life . the benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me . i simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth , and wash it off . no prescriptions , no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me . amazing ! ! !"

neg,"i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it 's retractable cord and folding capabilities . even the price was attractive . it really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus . i thought i had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly . now for the bad news : the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time . then , the folding handle , low and behold , broke in half one morning . ( of course , the warranty had long expired ) . this dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and i consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers . when i 've replaced hair dryers in the past , it was been because they 've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out . i 'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer 's lifespan . i 've now purchased a t3 tourmaline ( a featherweight , quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan ."

neg,"i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "" concert experience "" . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard ."

neg,"with the greatest respect to the incredible bob beldon , joe zawinul , and wayne shorter , this box set should contain a warning . the warning is simple : if you already own most of the stuff in this collection , do n't bother . if you 're completely new to weather report , buy it . coming from someone that 's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few "" other "" releases , i was really disappointed with this project ( except for the booklet ) . here are a few things that are puzzling : 1 ) a weather report box set includes three songs ( two composed by zawinul and one by shorter ) that were never released by weather report : a . in a silent way . released by miles davis b. super nova , released by wayne shorter c . experience in e ( excerpt ) , released by cannonball adderly ( i agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors , but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print ) 2 ) an incredible typo stating that alphonse mouzon was the drummer on "" unknown soldier "" 3 ) including a barely improved version of nubian sundance that has been in circulation for many years from "" other "" sources . 4 ) including another "" better than , but not by much "" version of the "" other "" sources for the 1978 rockpalast concert on dvd . 5 ) not remastering any of the original recordings . the tape hiss from the live in tokyo ( i sing the body electric ) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age . 6 ) finally , the cover itself - i have no words , except to admit "" i do n't get it "" . having said all that negative stuff - weather report remains the dominant "" creative machine "" of the jazz rock fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating . if you 're a long time weather report fan - there 's absolutely nothing to get excited about here . the dvd was especially disappointing to me . i have had that concert on vhs tape for many years and now on dvd ( all from "" other "" sources ) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version . zawinul 's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places . ( i played the dvd in 5 different players ; two tv 's and my computer monitor to make sure it was n't my equipment ) . i should have paid attention to the pr person at sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and not from the master tapes . it 's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations . i should probably clarify that while the dvd is in fact clearly better than the "" un-offical "" version , it still looks like a bootleg ! sad.. . it is of some significance that this "" review "" is the first time i 've chosen to speak out about something in fusion that was less than flattering . it should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at cbs / sony / bmg and not the musicians / producers . i 'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered mahavishnu orchestra live in cleveland cd that was supposed to be released in 2004. lastly , let me make it perfectly clear that zawinul , shorter , and beldon are musicians and people i personally hold in the highest esteem with zawinul and shorter being musical divinities as far as i 'm concerned . while my review is an obvious personal venting , and i realize that zawinul and shorter gave this project their stamp of approval , i think that should n't be mistaken for a personal attack . my remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at cbs / sony / bmg . by rick calic jazz rock world"
neg,"beautiful voice , but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd . i was offended just reading every name on this cd...it is really a shame , what pretty "" vulgar "" voice . if this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears . you should be ashamed of yourself as an artist , as you have such power , but it is spent on prepetuating hate . nina simone was a angry artist also , but not once did she offend me ( caucasian male ) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america . the first song i ever heard of hers "" mississippi goddam "" made me cry , so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice . there will always be a "" racist america "" because people are selfish , but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist . i liked the cd until i heard the lyrics , one less sale adds up after awhile"

neg,""" genius "" is an educational simulation game , where you 're building an industrial complex - - plop down factories , roads , houses , fire departments and such . as the game progresses , you complete physics puzzles to obtain new technologies and product improvements . you subscribe to newspapers , which contain answers to some questions and the knowledge or equations needed to solve others . the physics problems are entertaining , well designed , well documented , implemented excellently , and can be quite fun . they are presented as problems you encounter during business operation , for example while developing a new product . all of the information you need is provided . the game will appeal to children 8 & up , but these physics problems are more like age 16 & up because they require high school math . so , children & youths may need help from a parent who remembers algebra and preferably physics - - yikes ! some of the questions are easy & fun . some require you to be comfortable with algebra , converting between units , and applying formulae . a few are very difficult . fortunately , the questions are the same each time , so after figuring out the answers , you can write them down & just enter the answers next time . sometimes the game even gives you the correct answer after it is too late , so you can write it down for next time . unfortunately , i ca n't find a cheat sheet list of answers on the web - - too bad , this would really help . the level of difficulty of these questions is n't a problem , just be warned . the simulation side of the game is suffers in comparison . the industrial simulation controls are poorly documented . what each building does and when / why / where it is appropriate / inappropriate and how to run the game is somewhat of a mystery . there 's no way to figure out whether building something will be good or bad except trial and error - - logic does n't always help . bad decisions spiral out of control , seem to lead inevitably to bankruptcy . unfortunately , wrong answers on the physics problems can have the same effect . there is a "" statistics "" report that is supposed to give feedback on whether your company is making or loosing money , but this form does n't have enough information . so , expect some trial & error , some frustration , some algebra , some physics , & some reading through magazines looking for obscure clues .

neg,"the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people . i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie . usually when a movie runs over 2 hours , it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in . in the case of hard boiled , the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for "" most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture . "" chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay , and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff . he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging from a rope , while sliding down a banister ( ! ) , while being hurled through the air by explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . and he shoots , and shoots , and shoots . and the bad guys shoot , and shoot , and shoot . and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot , and shoot , and - - you get the idea . there are some fine action scenes in this film , but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended . there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next , and it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled . there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire"

pos,"with engines of creation , joe satriani did what he has always done : make the most of the tools he chooses to use . only this time , he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar . it would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote "" satch boogie , "" "" war "" and "" flying in a blue dream "" went . well , he 's still here , only more than ever he 's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey . i 've never heard robots having sex , but i 'm willing to be "" borg sex "" is n't far off . and although his calmly passing , sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure , that 's kinda how you 'd expect to see "" clouds race across the sky .

neg,"ethan mordden 's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book . this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs . his political ramblings ( often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense ) seep through the book , dragging it down . the french people are slammed a number of times , along with the aclu , burt lancaster ( apparently , according to ethan a good friend of stalin ) and the left in general , while the author defends bush ( and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre ) . the author 's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target , any target . it is often hard to stomach . the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that , it can actually make one want to look at the work again . an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public . the author is capable of better work"

pos,this shaver replaced a norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days . i ca n't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because i have n't shaved with a blade in many years . i have used foil shavers in the past ( braun and panasonic ) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it . i have been using this shaver for about 3 months . during that time i have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day . at first i thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought was doing a great job . it shaves quick and close ( personally i think as close as a blade ) . when you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry . it does n't get any easier than that . i have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too . the only con is i have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving and i think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation . highly recommended and worth the price .

pos,"i heard the first beat lp ( & quot ; i just ca n't stop it&quot ; ) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band 's brand of ska / soul / rock . for some strange reason , i never bought & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; and never got familiar with it . i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away . of course , i did buy & quot ; special beat service&quot ; and found it to be par excellent . so i ordered & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i 've been wearing it out . damn ! how did i miss this ? this is a great collection of snaky sweet , politically smart songs . & quot ; doors of your heart&quot ; ... i 've loved that song for years.. . and & quot ; too nice to talk to&quot ; has always been a favorite . but every other single song on this cd , including the bonus tracks , is outstanding . these songs are textural wonders . great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording . i regret not discovering it sooner , but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact . oh yeah.. . one more thing.. . i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he 's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him . if he comes to a venue near you , do n't miss the show . you 'll get your money 's worth and more . wear your dancin ' shoes . he is truly one of the great talents of the 80 's and continues to make significant music . he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades . buy this cd . you wo n't regret it . it sounds best in the early evening . i 'm the big oh and i gotta go"
neg,"i do n't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful , with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to . john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he 's doing a ( bad ) imitation of michael crawford in & quot ; hello , dolly . &quot ; he does strange things to his words - i guess he 's trying not to sound british , but why is he singing & quot ; summ-ar weath-ar&quot ; instead of & quot ; summer weather&quot ; ? the ilona is a bass - almost literally . & quot ; i resolve&quot ; has been lowered for her , and yet she still cannot master the range of the song . to accomodate her , the second part of & quot ; i do n't know his name&quot ; has a truly odd key change . were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing , but she 's not worth it . the orchestrations are odd , too , with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently . the rest of the singers range from fair ( kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression ) to bad ( mr. maraczek drags down every single note of & quot ; days gone by . &quot ; luckily this is his only song . ) the broadway revival , to my ear , still has the best voices , except , of course , that barbara cook ( the original ) outshines diane fratantoni , who is merely good ( but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout 's original amalia , the annoying judy kuhn . ) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans , or masochists . i 'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of & quot ; you 've got mail&quot ; than listen to this again"

neg,"i loved ' ' careless love ` ` and saw madeleine live here in rio de janeiro in a reasonably good show.i am quite disappointed with this album however because i had great expectations.let 's face it folks , however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.she needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.this is obvious from seeing her live . so what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight on her vocal delivery ? those songs need an ella , a sarah vaughn , or even a shirley horn -to name some giants - to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range , timing and phrasing . to compound the problem , the recording engineers / producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.everything is much too soft and distant ( unlike careless love ) .if you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last shirley horn cds . last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to very minimalist backing chores . i think there is a misconception with the record excecs that m.p. has the qualities to make her a modern pop-jazz diva ala diana krall.she has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.good luck ."

pos,"asks the interviewer , "" what place would you give shoot the piano player in relation to your other films ? "" answers director françois truffaut , "" no place . simply the second film i made . "" considering his first feature film was the four hundred blows and his third was jules et jim , truffaut 's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile . shoot the piano player is worth smiles , too . it 's a clever film , playful at times , even funny . more than anything , however , it defies categorization . the movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy , suspense and inevitability , tragedy and love , and gangsters , girl friends and violence . it 's the story of charlie koller ( charles aznavour ) , a piano player in a paris dive , who used to be eduoard saroyan , a famous pianist , whose wife committed suicide . truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man . charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants . he ca n't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing . he thinks about what he should do , but ca n't do it , and then circumstances take over . charlie , thanks to his brothers , finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow . some say shoot the piano player is an homage to american gangster films . perhaps it is , but i challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie . the film is original , funny , moving and sad . it 's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about . all i know is that i was moved by charlie . we leave him where we met him , playing piano in a paris dive . charles aznavour , a diminutive man with a hangdog look , plays charlie perfectly . aznavour is probably better known in the u. s . as a singer , but in france he 's seen as both an actor and a singer . he 's a minimalist , he says about himself . charlie thinks too much and does too little . aznavour lets us see into charlie 's soul with few words . it 's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by charlie , but liking him . the criterion dvd transfer is first-rate . criterion gives us two discs . the first has the movie and a commentary track . the second disc contains interviews by aznavour and marie dubois , who played charlie 's girlfriend , lena , plus excerpts from documentaries featuring truffaut , and other extras . the criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and truffaut"

( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $1000 camera body ) . ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon . when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses , and selling my entire powershot kit . if you are an experienced photographer , you will not like this system at all"

pos,"having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years , i approached digital photography with great reluctance . i knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures , like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid - - this further delayed my plunge . finally , an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue . my choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006. we ran them as a screen saver , and i was much impressed by the sharpness , color tonality , and depth of field - - especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares . faces far into the background were discernable . i asked what was used and it was this camera . at the camera store i was heartened to see it felt like a mini slr in the hand , had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated , straightforward controls . the learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts . lack of no-shake feature is the model 's biggest downside ; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects . some of this you learn to shake out using point focus , but you still are going to lose a few precious moments despite your best efforts . nor with the limited equivalent asa range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good slr and high speed film - - but remember , this one is a starter . this thing is a monster battery eater , too : always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you . on the plus side , choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature , and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects . speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals , i do n't know , but its a whole world superior to my old world . there is a rather steely patina to even the best color images , i see now after viewing hundreds , but that 's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity . incidentally , the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating . back from europe this week , i have 2000+ jpegs ( the keepers ) all of very high quality , an achievement i could not have come close to , i am sure , either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals . the continuing issue of shake and blur i surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot ( sometimes 5-7 images ) ; you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them , and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off . i do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera , but even after i move up i think i will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world . for the price , this is about as good a deal as one can hope for ."

pos,"without a doubt , this is a must-have for any fan of the go-betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band . "" a man far wiser than myself once referred to "" 16 lovers lane "" as ' the indie rumours ' "" the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the go-betweens ultimate set of songs . no truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set . why this album did n't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved . but needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-release for those of you unfamiliar with the go-betweens work , this was the consummate work of their 80 's heyday , for a great many reasons . the music is bright pop music , crystal clear , but in no way is it featherweight pop . the songs are beautifully arranged , every instrument , vocal , handclap , and anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place , but this can be said of nearly every go-betweens release . the lyrics , plaintive ruminations on love , are clearly written by two songwriters / lyricists going through the opposite sides of relationships . i will not go into detail here as the liner notes tell the story , but the interplay within the band as these relationships play out are what drove the entire release . each lyricist , grant mclennan and robert forster , gets about half of the album 's lyrics , and that is what makes the cd special . images of the giddyness of new love ( "" love goes on ! "" ) are juxtaposed with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking . "" i 'm ten feet under water / standing in a sunken canoe / looking up at the water lillies / they 're green and violet blue / still the sun it finds / a place to light me "" from "" love is a sign "" has to be one of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship falls apart that has ever been placed in song . these themes are repeatedly dealt with in different ways , from young lovers meeting and breaking up to the "" old "" love of couples with children ( "" you ca n't say no forever "" ) having a fight . the bonus material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome . the videos to "" streets of your town "" ( still undoubtedly the best song on this incredible collection ) and "" was there anything i could do ? "" underscore the relationships going on in the band while not seeming too terribly out of date . the bonus disc of outtakes and b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes several songs that did n't make the final album cut but are presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions , being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo . the real treat come with the acoustic "" demos "" that are included . "" you wo n't find it again , "" "" apples in bed , "" and "" head over heels "" are played only by mclennan and forster on acoustic guitars , providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere . to top it all off , the packaging ( including an awesome essay by british songwriter andrew male ) is exquisite , providing detail on the circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent recording information . this is "" 16 lovers lane "" as it was meant to be heard- -enjoy !"

pos,"the living in oblivion series of cd compilations does something that many similar compilations do not do : they give us some great variety of "" hits "" . there is no doubt that "" mickey "" by toni basil was a huge hit . there 's also no doubt that "" our lips are sealed "" was a break out hit for the go go 's , but the funboy three version wasn't . but what about "" living in a box "" ? it only hit the billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. so why is it here ? why are a large number of these songs ? they 're not top 10 hits , right ? wrong ! i 'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80's . the u.s. music tastes are typically very different from those of europe . just because a song does n't make the u.s. billboard top 40 does n't mean that it is n't a hit in other countries . and although i 'm an american , my music tastes have always run more in line with those of europe . i 'm delighted that the living in oblivion series ( and the pop and wave series ) have incorporated a variety of hits from the u.s. and europe . i also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations . there are several songs on these albums that never were released on cd ( as they had n't come into being at the time of the groups ' albums initial releases ) , so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits . the boys do n't cry song "" i wanna be a cowboy "" hit the billboard charts at #12 in 1986 , but the group disappeared soon thereafter . then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000 's and rocketed up the dance charts . do n't be misled , the living in oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80's . if you want to hear run of the mill , top 40 only hits from the 80 's , well , then you 'll just have to look elsewhere . also , the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever . you get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song 's release . my only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing . apparently many believe that the music from the 80 's was vacuous and devoid of emotion . one need only listen to the song "" the promise "" by the group "" when in rome "" ( living in oblivion volume 5 ) to know that such a statement is false . while that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity , "" the promise "" made the billboard top 100 at #11 and the billboard dance chart at #1. anyway.. . i ca n't recommend this album and its entire series any more ! it 's simply awesome ! before believing those who would disparage this series of albums , please check the billboard charts and you 'll see that these songs were in fact hits . get it"

neg,"the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd , the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars . this set was poorly put together , the shorts included are quite random , and buying this set would be a waste of money . each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters . first there is alfalfa , then buckwheat , spanky , darla , porky , mickey , stymie , then fatty - oh wait , no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name , then farina , and last phil macmahon - who you may be asking ? phil macmahon , the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938. still do n't know him ? maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection . disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day . dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot ; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series . however , it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score . derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series . it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races . the films themselves are very good . disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright . it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents . it is a total disaster . just like in reunion in rhythm , one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry . the film has been seriously cut ; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length . the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted . the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores , but it works . there are sound effects too . sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train . it is a very cute film ; farina is especially funny in it . the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood . the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks . the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers . it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship . when it sinks , they find a real one to destroy . this short has also been cut ; there is no opener for it either . it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it . disk three opens with mary queen of tots . it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang . she dreams they come to life , and when she wakes up , she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life . this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set . it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though . the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters . the print on this one is not bad at all . the last film is school 's out , a talkie featuring a different cast . it is a film featuring miss crabtree , the new teacher . the picture is good ; it seems to be the one from cabin fever . disk four begins with bear shooters . this is a less than great film . the print is great ; it is the one from cabin fever . our gang follies of 1938 is a great film , very funny , long , and exciting . it features the later talkie cast . waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years , a lesser film that seems forced . it was also released in a 5 part rascals set . disk five is the extra features dvd . it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show . on it , some of the silent gang are reunited . joe cobb , jackie condon , farina hoskins , johnny downs , and mickey daniels are featured . the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview . other child stars like jackie coogan , judy garland , shirley temple , roddy mcdowall , and ron howard are focused on as well . the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain . many of them have been available cheaply for years . the only reason a fan might want to see this collection , the same reason i bothered , was to see the rarer silent films . however , the rest of the set is trash"

pos,"richard fortney 's "" earth "" is a survey , in mostly layman 's terms , of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind . fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth , selecting a series of locations where the earth 's geology is apparent , and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding . fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy , preceeds to the hawaiian islands , hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world . fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is . this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the "" supercontinent "" of gondwana . for each location , fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location . along the way , fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes . the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective . fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote . large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences . it turns out , for example , that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates ( north america , ocean bottom , and northern europe ) . the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney 's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands . the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages , and fortney 's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader . nevertheless , this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history"
neg,"i bought this audio cd set at the borders store , without the opportunity to preview the narration . had i been able to do so , i probably never would have purchased it , let alone paid full bookstore price for it . but i needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day , so i relented . lesson learned . the audio quality is very insonsistent , at at times very poor , having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording . while the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the middle east , it does read very much like a history text . with the amount of detail presented , and the wide scope of coverage from one end of europe reaching into the former soviet states and beyond , one immediately feels the need for visual aids ( maps , timelines , etc. ) as guidance . the reader 's narration is monotononous , with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses . each sentence sounds the same as the last . this has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other , and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity . after a while , the narration becomes little more than background noise . no information is retained by the listener"
pos,"theodore b . taylor , the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004 , but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester . even though the text of this book originally appeared in "" the new yorker "" in 1973 , taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation . mcphee has a very understated style ( "" just the facts , ma'am "" ) , but this book is still the most frightening i 've ever read . i ca n't decide whether i would want him to write a sequel , because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973. just ask yourself the following questions : is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973 ? yes . do more nations have nuclear capability ? yes . can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart ? yes . are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973 ? yes . do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973 ? decide this one for yourself . john mcphee , staff writer for the "" new yorker "" and pulitzer-prize-winning author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine , has written a nuclear explosion of a book in "" the curve of binding energy . "" it 's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written . essentially , it 's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand , along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u-235 or plutonium . theodore b . taylor , himself the creator of smaller , more efficient nuclear bombs , tells us where to steal the plutonium , how to assemble a bomb , even gives hints on where to plant it- -one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now-vanished towers of the world trade center , trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage .

neg,"this series represents the second attempt to revive tz , and is vastly inferior to its predecessor . the series began with some built-in problems , particularly the choice of forest whitaker as host-narrator . mr. whitaker is a fine actor , but a poor choice to host the series , and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes , often walking around while delivering his opening lines . after watching some of these episodes , one can understand forest 's discomfort ; he probably regretted accepting the job . another major problem is that this series came out on upn , which has never been ( and never will be ) a leader in quality programming . although there are some interesting story ideas , they usually fall flat in the end . "" it 's still a good life "" is a noteworthy example . intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series , and featuring original cast members cloris leachman and bill mumy ( with the addition of mumy 's daughter , liliana ) , this episode gets off to a good start , but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn , leading to a rushed , nonsensical , and unsatisfying conclusion . this sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series . talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing . this series resembles the original in name only , and even the worst of the mid-80 's episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly , poorly-written , lame stories . the kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged . enjoy it for what it is , but , as andy taylor once told gomer pyle , "" do n't over-expect .

neg,"i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour . in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour . again , the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again . i find most of this album to be very average . actually after listening , this album is not very good at all . the majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics . there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "" safe in new york city "" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic . probably one of the bands weakest efforts"
pos,"many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career . for peter gabriel , every album is an experiment . usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm ; however , on gabriel 's fifth experiment , so , the ex-genesis frontman does the exact opposite . gabriel , beloved for always doing something different , decided on this album to play it safe - and for gabriel , that is an experiment . previously he was a sort of cult performer , but on so , gabriel finally made it into the spotlight . big time . so was an immense success , peaking at number one on the billboard top 100 , receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews ( in 2003 , so placed 187th on rolling stone 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time ) , and resulting in a sold-out tour . which brings us to one nagging term : "" sellout "" . though most who loved peter gabriel 's first four albums loved so as well , there are still many who call so gabriel 's sellout album . to me , that 's just foolishness . peter gabriel has never "" sold out "" and i have no doubt that he never will . it 's clear that on so he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction , but that 's probably the biggest experiment gabriel has ever undertaken , save for his subsequent release , passion . one popular theory amongst gabriel fans is that the album 's title , so , is in fact an acronym for "" sell out "" ( hence the uppercase capital "" s "" and the lowercase italicized "" o "" ) . i would n't be surprised at all if it was . so does sound very different from gabriel 's earlier albums ( though then again , none of those sounded alike either ) . if anything , it resembles gabriel 's third self-titled release , nicknamed melt . the thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on so - is a feeling of warmth on that album , unlike the harsh , gritty darkness of melt . perhaps that 's why listeners found so so charming . what does so have to offer ? well , a lot . for one thing , there 's the atmospheric opening , "" red rain "" , one of gabriel 's finest tracks . like many of the tracks on the album , it 's dominated by ethereal guitar from david rhodes and heavenly synthesizers , courtesy of gabriel himself . then there 's one of the biggest hits of 1980s ( which also spawned what may be the best music video in history ) , "" sledgehammer , "" inspired by the motown music gabriel listened to as a child . with its pounding , industrial percussion , playful bass ( by gabriel 's exclusive bass man , tony levin ) and clever , sexually suggestive lyrics , it 's no surprise that "" sledgehammer "" was a hit . after letting his silly side out , gabriel tries to inspire with "" do n't give up "" , a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician , kate bush . the subsequent track , "" that voice again "" , is my personal favorite song from this album . it features some excellent drumming from manu katche , an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like sting , along with misty guitars , delightful synthesizers , and fine lyrics hit home by gabriel 's pained singing . like the best tracks on so , "" that voice again "" manages to be fun , moody , uplifting , powerful , warm , and inspirational , all at once . gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy , powerful "" mercy street "" , a song inspired by and written about anne sexton , an american mental patient who relieved her depression through writing . as on his previous albums , gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out "" big time "" , a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video . "" big time "" features heavy drumming from stewart copeland , the former drummer of the police , as well as some awesome cmi by simon clark . "" we do what we 're told ( miligram 's 37 ) "" is about the experiments of yale professor stanley milgram . milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors , who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible . milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do , despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors . he follows that rather cold song with "" this is the picture ( excellent birds ) "" , a tensely surreal tune . the album closes with one of gabriel 's most famous songs , "" in your eyes "" . most people are familiar with the song from its usage in cameron crowe 's romantic comedy masterpiece ... say anything , where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history . it 's one of gabriel 's warmest and most romantic compositions , and also one of his best . on the original lp version of so , "" we do what we 're told "" closed out the album . that 's a fine way to end it , but it 's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album . when the album was re-released remastered on cd in 2002 , gabriel placed "" in your eyes "" at the end of the album as he originally intended . now that is the way to end it ! so - how does so rank among the many other brilliant works of peter gabriel ? well , it ranks quite highly , actually . it 's one of the pinnacles of gabriel 's career , though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say . after all , how can one compare gabriel 's albums when they are all so vastly different ? certainly , though , so is one of the finest gabriel masterpieces . this is fun , well-crafted , emotional music . so is so wonderful ."

pos,"through most of the 1990s , i lived overseas in both europe and asia . unfortunately , my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a "" tourist "" with my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend 's t1 and being impressed with the size of it . the t7 is obviously considerably smaller , which is even better ! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro . both are investments that even to this day ( over a year later ) i am very happy with . i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it . i can say i 've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes . as far as size , that is the biggest plus to it 's advantage . it can fit anywhere . even with the optional case that you can buy for it , it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket , without even a noticable bulge . as far as photo quality goes , as most of the reviews note , the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots . i 've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you 'll get , but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash , what can you expect ? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera , i know what will be a good and bad night shot , and with the playback feature , you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed . is it perfect ? no , but that 's super tough in a camera this small . some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still . i 've never had issue with this , but i could see how it could be an issue , it 's just never one either my wife ( the primary user ) or i have dealt with . i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem . i 've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger ( and more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i have been very pleased with that . another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it . i put a plastic screen protector ( the thin plastic sheet type held by static ) on it as soon as i bought it and have n't had a problem . i 've sat on the camera before ( by accident , of course ! ) and have had it in luggage and the like , but have never had a problem . the most significant drawback that i 've had with the camera is that it can take more photos ( esp with the 1gb card ) than the battery will last . buy a second battery and you 'll be more than good , but it 's just something to keep in mind . i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels , or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos . it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots , it 's all that you need . i can say that we have many photos of our kids ( and really good ones , too ) that we would never had gotten if my wife did n't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag ! i 'm happy enough with it that i 'm going to buy a second one for myself ( especially now that the prices have dropped so much ! ) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography . i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others"

neg,"first off : i 'd like it better if we had 1 / 2-star options . judas unchained really does n't deserve a 2 , more a 2-1 / 2 or 2-3 / 4. i have a love / hate relationship with peter hamilton 's books . he 's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but , as with a lot of these hard-science , libertarian sf authors , he badly needs an editor . i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel , pandora 's star . he also has far too many "" main characters "" who ( despite 800+ pages ) never seem to come alive . they all speak with essentially the same voice . and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped ' 60s era hippies - - come on , does anyone seriously say "" dude "" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century ? and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young ( or rejuvenated ) women ? hamilton 's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best . on the one hand , the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed , represented and believable . on the other hand , the dynamics of the relationship between "" old timers "" and "" first lifers "" is unsatisfactory . in four centuries , for example , no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty ? perhaps the commonwealth 's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here , the government ( controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties ) controls it . another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life did n't change - - i mean the characters of a novel ( almost by definition ) are dynamic , go-get - 'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die . why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime ? the aliens are ok . the problem with them ( and this is true of nearly every sf story ) is that they tend to be one dimensional - - they 're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up . ( this is a problem in fantasy stories , too . ) on the plus side , i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien "" deus ex machina . "" ozzie 's adventures in "" wonderland "" ( i.e. , the silfen paths ) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge does n't really help anyone defeat the primes . overall , if you started with pandora 's star , you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained . if you have n't started down this "" silfen path , "" i recommend alistair reynolds , tony daniel or iain banks . they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date"
neg,"first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage . besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire , he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point , that was of course before 50 's influence which brings us to our problem . the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album . i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south . if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks , verses etc. everything may have been fine . the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "" a "" is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable . this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50 's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south 's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise 's up . this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he 's dropped but , im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what 's in your heart and get back to business ."

pos,"great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners"

pos,""" quinceanera "" happy birthday ? ? ? amos lassen and literary pride one of the great mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie "" quinceanera "" , a traditional rite of passage . it takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood . magdalena ( emily rios ) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret- -she is pregnant . she was raised a devout catholic girl and the fact that she is "" with child "" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her . distraught by her banishment from her family , magdalena turns to her uncle tomas ( chalo gonzales ) who lives with her cousin , carlos ( jesse garcia ) in a small apartment in echo park , los angeles . carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood . what results is a ménage a trios between carlos and the couple , one a television producer and the other a british citizen . carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes magdalena 's new family unit . in effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men . what results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in american films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with . performances are excellent in the film and the directors richard glatzner and wash westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen . emily rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and chalo gonzalez as uncle tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten . he is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal . everything about this movie is fine , the script , the actors , the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made . awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 sundance festival , "" quinceanera "" is a marvelous film- -especially because it wears its queerness so well , the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality , maturation , culture clashes and love . simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed ."

"" not for you , "" with it 's lyrics about how eddie vedder 's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes , is a none-too-subtle complaint about pearl jam 's status as "" millions served "" rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk . that , of course , is more directly the point of "" spin the black circle , "" an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to sst-era husker du . for vedder , the joys of vinyl are that they seem "" warmer "" - -a symbol of "" tradional values "" in a rock ' n ' roll sense : independence , hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny , sterile corporate plastic of compact discs . never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture ; vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12 "" record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves . pearl jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference . on the other hand , the big corporate evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience , which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of "" vitalogy "" - -it 's designed as a salute / satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical / mental / spiritual hygeine . the album , therefore , aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band 's own youth ( the who , neil young ) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the power of rock ( fugazi , sonic youth ) - -hence the title . the album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like "" bugs "" and "" hey foxymophandlemama that 's me , "" even though they 're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel . still , some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like "" last exit "" and the somewhat proggy sea chanty "" tremor christ "" ( whose title i dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement ) . even though it 's uneven , "" vitalogy "" is the work of a self-reliant , even ornery band that 's in full control of their ideas- -even the bad ones . it 's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like stone temple pilots and matchbox 20."

neg,"i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others , hoping to learn about america 's prison system . i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic . unfortunately , in the first twenty pages of the book , elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 , 000 citizens . if you do the math , that equals 7% of our population . 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york . according to this author , there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york . before you get too worried , let me reassure you that this is not the case . america imprisons 736 people per *100 , 000* citizens ( as of 5 / 06 ) , or .736% of the population . this is the highest rate in the entire world , so there 's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic . for comparison , stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges . again , there 's really no need to exaggerate america 's rate of incarceration . what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page , but is repeated several times . apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population , and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well , as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover . personally , i ca n't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out , on the first twenty pages no less . if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 , how do we know the rest of the book is n't off by a power of 10 ? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine . do n't buy this book"

neg,"i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven 's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release . considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and alec baldwin groupies ( a.k.a. my mom , my stepfather , and me ) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment . baldwin , who also served as co-producer , brought james lee burke 's new orleans ex-cop / recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen . while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy tough-guy / gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things : 1. ) the film 's slo-o-o-ow pacing . maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone , not just baldwin . of all the actors , long island native baldwin sweats the most , so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane ! 2. ) a plot that , as rendered in the film ( whether it 's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor , i ca n't be sure ) , never quite follows through on any of its elements . it 's too bad , because these elements could 've made for an exciting movie : drug dealing , illegal alien smuggling , rival crime bosses ( one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself , essentially playing a southern-fried version of his character from director phil joanou 's 1992 thriller final analysis ) , an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl ( named "" alafair "" by the robichouxs , after dave 's mom . late in my pregnancy at the time , i liked the name alafair so much , i nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter siobhan ! ) , and a bevy of beautiful , beguiling women , including earth mother kelly lynch , vampy teri hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time , and mary stuart masterson , looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her : a troubled stripper who loves robichoux . despite the sexy promises in the movie 's ads , none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and / or embraces . maybe the climate was already so hot , the filmmakers did n't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration ! as my mom put it at the time : "" i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy , dashing alec baldwin , but he came up sweaty , rumpled , tired , depressed , and moving as if he was in slow motion . if he 'd made love as many times as he got beaten up , it would 've been the sexiest picture of ' 96 ! "" to be fair , there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes , but there 's just too darn much talky , molasses-paced lag time between them - - and yet , oddly , some of the scenes end abruptly just as they 're about to become intriguing ! perhaps joanou , baldwin & co. could 've dredged a tighter , more involving thriller out of this if they 'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so . as heaven 's prisoners is now...well , read james lee burke 's books instead ."
neg,"taxcut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete , nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand . many terms of art are not defined at all . most disturbingly , when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing , but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file , the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing . this bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for h&r block , unfortunately . i called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5. i told them that i thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal , and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice . finally , the program crashed several times while i was using it . although the data was always saved , it was quite obnoxious . i run a high-performance , well-maintained mac powerbook , so i 'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly . next year i 'll go with turbotax ."

pos,"this dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of christianity ; it discusses an alternate viewpoint ( as dan brown reminds us "" the winners write the history books "" ) this dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with ; esp . the idea of god as male , and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership . this dvd includes interviews with dan burstein , henry lincoln , martin lunn , lynn picknett , clive prince , dr. karen ralls , dr. james robinson , and margaret starbird . i particularly liked margaret starbird 's interviews - she describes how when she first read "" holy blood , holy grail "" , she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal catholic . but afterward , she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research mary magdalene and write "" the woman with the alabaster jar "" . she comes across as very rational , sensible and even heroic . it takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority . i thought dan burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of jewish people during the time jesus lived . i think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that does n't mean it is necessarily the truth . to be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live"

neg,"incredible does describe this movie - incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "" mississippi burning "" or the anger and impunity of "" ghosts of mississippi "" , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade "" miss congeniality "" type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l . jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not "" a powerful film . "" it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like "" mississippis burning , "" that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies"

neg,"mortal kombat : annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it . from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters ( odd , considering that in interviews after the first movie , all of them said they 'd want / be willing to come back for a sequel ) , to the horrible ( even by 1997 standards ) cg effects , to the cliched fight scenes ( gee...two women in a mud pit . i bet it took them all night to come up with that one ) , virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie . loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game ( and set immediately after the first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger ) , the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan ( played by brian thompson , the alien bounty hunter from the x-files ) and his army ( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras . oooh...scary . ) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld . this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity . with only a week to do anything about it , lord raiden ( played by james remar , replacing the , and i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , much better christopher lambert in the role ) once again enlists the help of liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , and princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , along with help from a select few other characters from the video games ' crowded lineup , to prevent this from happening . the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad . however , given the film 's obviously low budget the weak screenplay , the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film , and most jarringly , direction even more inept than that of paul w.s. anderson , it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high , only to have practically everything come crashing down . the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack , featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie , as well as music by kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , and others . if ever you 're looking to punish yourself for something , then by all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself , you will avoid this movie like the plague . believe me , you 'll thank yourself later ."

pos,"the panasonic pv-gs500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of panasonic 's new 2007 models which will be available in the spring . the pv-gs500 is compact , delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above , has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer . it lacks an audio output jack , which many will fault it for . it does have a separate microphone jack . the menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use . it is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact , uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that . low-light performance is poor , but there is an accessory shoe , so you can mount an auxillary light . i would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings , parties and other group events . battery life is about what you would expect , so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended . all in all , a very nice 3ccd camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package . jerr"

neg,"the first was one of the best thrillers ever , with clever suspence , good characters , decent acting and awesome effects . this one is.. . meh . why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series ? what 's the bloody point ? now there are some good parts . the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent , but you know , that does n't even save it . this movie is a annoying , pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love . it is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . the characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i do n't even know them well . all they do is scream , run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate the effects in this one as well . they felt like they were over-used . there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was . the direction is ok , but when it comes to adding wierdness , it 's too much . i do n't understand the story , there 's a strange sex-scene which a cube movie does not need . cube is about suspence . this one is just about adding too much effects , a four-dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one . you do n't need that stuff . if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first , add something original , do n't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original . but no , you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it 's a cube movie , you do n't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes . if you 're a fan of cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3 / 10 ugh , do n't get me started . these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die . gore factor : 4 / 10 cgi gore ? ! come on ! ? t&a : 1 / 10 a cube movie does n't need nudity and they do n't know that because they do n't know cube . direction : 7 / 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts . i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms , but you know , i ca n't say he 's a great director . he turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you 'll be sorry . this movie is just sad . it does n't try anything to impress you because it 's idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again"

pos,"this is a camcorder for the digital age . tiny , multi-functional , and flexible . no ancient-technology magnetic tape . as with any product on the leading edge , there are many shortcomings . let 's dispense with the obvious . this device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease . for best image quality , a dedicated mini-dv camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go . in fact , buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the sanyo c6 while resulting in superior quality . overall image quality is best described as "" ok "" . the poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device . the flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light . in addition , since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens , red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range . this is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice , but plan on touching up more often . low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode . virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this sanyo in video mode in any situation , but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the xacti c6. also , to be clear , the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders . for all these negatives , the convenience can be truly revolutionary . one can wear the tiny vpc-c6 around the neck all day . this causes an amazing change in attitude towards video . since the sanyo is so compact , no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel . being freed from the chore of "" packing up "" a camcorder means a corresponding willingness to bring the sanyo on so many more occasions , such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties . and whereas a mini-dv camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour 's worth of video to your computer , the sanyo transfers video as fast as the sd card and usb 2.0 interface will allow . that means five minutes or less to transfer one hour 's worth of video to a computer . this ease increases willingess to create video and share video . no more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer . with the sanyo , just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a usb flash drive . it is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience . video becomes an everyday pleasure , if one so wishes , rather than a special occasion chore . if one values this convenience over absolute image quality , this is the product to own . this is a leading edge product . to get the most of this product , i highly recommend doing the following : 1 ) sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website . this fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders . in addition , this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb sd cards ( the limit is 2gb without the update ) . kudos to sanyo for the continuing support . ( note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the set button to the left to enter the firmware update screen . ) 2 ) the video is in mp4 format and is playable only with quicktime . for windows users , this limits video editing to the included programs or quicktime-specific programs . there is an easy solution . first , download the divx codec ( a freeware commercial product ) or xvid codec ( a free open source product - my preference ) or ffdshow ( a free open source product ) - use your search engine of choice to find these . second , download a utility called "" mp4cam2avi "" ( a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice ) . with these two programs , the video becomes compatable with any windows program , including just about any media player ( such as windows media player ) and any video editing tool ( such as windows movie maker ) . i look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves . the freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and i am sure the image quality will continue to improve . for now , i am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had i continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder"

pos,"one of the best-directed films of 2006 , "" kiss kiss bang bang "" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences . and even though "" kiss kiss bang bang "" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue , or to untangle the plot , one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill : it 's a class-a tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that shane black pulls off here , with "" kkbb "" ' s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy . if that seems like an easy feat , well.. . remember "" 1941 "" ? not even spielberg got it right . but shane black nails it here - - and it 's his directorial debut . downey & kilmer are also at the top of their game here , but it 's michelle monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans .

pos,"peter balakian 's book , "" black dog of fate , "" tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them . in essence , it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian-american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling . i wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non-armenians , for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first . i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative , unengaged and unconvincing . pity , since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football , the yankees , modern poetry , and exposing turkish attempts to buy ( among others ) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism , practiced by the "" modern "" turkish state and its organs . it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels . the "" i "" and "" we "" and "" us "" occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice . but is it realy ? since in order to make this legitimate , the writer must distance himself , at least initially , from all this old world exotica , and like the reader , question their validity or relevance in present day north american society . what are all these old world , old fashioned ghosts and traditions ? , is the first cry of writer and reader alike , only , ofcourse , to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic , memory-free , self-redefining , "" comfort "" seeking and buying mores . in the balakian tale , one encounters suburbia instead of substance , worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul , immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism , the abstract and unemotional , or else towards medicine , respectability and detachment . young balakian observes but never understands "" the grandmother "" for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find . their crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of america 's mixmaster piper . "" be unlike your past and your future will be brighter , "" seems to be what america promises , at the very least . the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying , as if to serve sweet irony , full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday . peter is lost alright , but as the book sadly shows , he remains lost . paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make . personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make ( for that , read vahakn dadrian 's "" the history of the armenian genocide "" berghahn books , 1995 ) . episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents , leading to more harm than good ( for if better evidence existed , the arguement goes , why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare ? ) . for the story to have worked , for the story to have *really* worked , as i would have liked it to , balakian 's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it , and his relationship with his wife who , like him , is not leading a strongly armenian existence , would have had to have changed , solidifying his roots , celebrating his new found identity , and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which , alas , never appear on the pages of this book . how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness , except that the transition has not occured ? the ship of armenianness sails by balakian . he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it , but not resolved enough to climb aboard . that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails . this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in . for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future , read mark arax 's book , "" in my father 's name ( simon & schuster , 1996 ) , "" where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax . one can only hope that balakian 's partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer ( not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th - - armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers ) . this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second . i speak here of "" passage to ararat "" by michael arlen ( hungry mind republication , 1996 ) where a disinterested soit-disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70 's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people 's woes and dreams . too little , too late , and always detached , is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation . much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold . however , i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home"

neg,"in many ways a relic of its era , "" not of this earth "" is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani ( a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of "" time machine "" , years later ) . the guitarist , supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai , a former student of satriani , ended up singing his teacher 's praises in the music press . the result is that this album , more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music , received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record . the album itself is a bit uneven- - satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist , but as a songwriter , he was n't quite ready . several pieces ( "" not of this earth "" , "" hordes of locusts "" ) seem to run out of steam before they end , and a couple ( "" the snake "" , "" driving at night "" ) feel like bad ' 80s metal . on the other hand , several pieces shine- - delicate and lovely "" rubina "" , reggaeish and emotionally soaked "" memories "" , and the overtly frippesque "" new day "" are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of . but my favorite is probably "" brother john "" , where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone . in the end , the album is ok , but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future . come back to this one if you 've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more , but most should start with "" surfing with the alien """

pos,"i think this is the best book that i have ever read . i thought that the civil war was very , very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong . the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more . from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye . each character has a different story of the war and of life . i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war . it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn . this book was excellent from the first page i read . even though this novel is very brilliant , some people might not like it . if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character , like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz . he had the funniest voice i ever heard . when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging . but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself . and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book . the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too , trust me . before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really , really new to me . i had to get use to it a little but since it was n't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman . some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife . another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion . another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy . i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story . in the story he sounds like he 's from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes . and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with . shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses , that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses . but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and does n't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces . that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart"

pos,"it was my full belief that the next time we would hear from buju banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated ` rasta got soul ' album . the album which has still yet to arrive ( and may never ) was said to be along buju 's best and might actually rival his seminal classic ` til shiloh . he even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album 's first single , the ` magical ' magic city . so the world was waiting to see just how much soul the album had . however . between then and now buju has been going through so many events that this album , too bad , almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics . forever , it seems that he is still living in the ` boom bye bye curse ' , and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling , he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is too bad . the album has a severe kick to it , it can actually sit not too far away from his ` stablemate ' assassin 's infiltrate from ` 05 , in terms of style . the attraction here is actually the subject of ` confusion' . while we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe , buju has n't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time . thus , the dj who was once the dancehall 's main attraction stepping back into the fray is n't at all a bad thing . so fans who sit longing for the days of stamina daddy and batty rider are the one 's who 'll be happy and i can fit into that camp as well ! but at the same time , buju 's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots , so now it is there where he will ultimately excel . however , with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims , you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again . the best tune here is probably the hard hard ` til it bend . til it bend is serious serious rudey dancehall . the song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear , but i guarantee that is the song most jamaican will pull up , til it bend is nice ! also check the wicked wicked nothing , who have it ? , the ultra clever better day and the nice hey boy over the petty thief riddim . however , my second favorite song here i would have to say would be the combination don & dupes with underrated dancehall singer pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently , largely due to his connection with madhouse head , dave kelly . buju makes an attempt ( for some reason ) at the useless wipeout riddim on me & unu and actually makes it work a little . also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as driver , which is easily one of the best tunes on the album . overall , the thought alone , buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is , this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans . while there is nothing here that i would call definitive roots reggae , this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of buju 's will find something they like . i would have like to have seen buju have at least one lenky riddim on the album , a wayne wonder combination ( although pinchers subs just fine ) and definitely the massive song beauty queen from the twice again riddim would have fit just fine here , but nevertheless , what you do have : high quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and too bad , over both what beenie and baby cham have done , is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date , and a boomshot in the arm for the genre"

neg,"steven spielberg 's classic masterpiece jaws did not have a stellar plot . it was a bubblegum storyline : a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast . in the hands of any other director , it would have been a terrible film , something to laugh at on lonely saturday nights while chowing down popcorn . in the hands of mr. spielberg , however , it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made . steven spielberg 's hands were nowhere near jaws : the revenge . okay , so here 's the plot . remember jaws 3-d ? well , that never happened . chief brody - from the first movie - is dead . his wife , ellen brody ( lorraine gary ) , is living a happy life in amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark . ellen flies down to the bahamas with her other son , michael brody ( lance guest ) . though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy , ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes , the one that chief brody killed - is back for revenge , hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one . even though it died . in the first movie . confused ? any sensible moviegoer would be . it 's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third jaws sequel . as you now know , the story is completely absurd . the script , by michael de guzman , is unintentionally hilarious , filled with outrageously funny dialogue . for example , in one scene , pilot hoagie ( played by michael caine ! ) is courting ellen brody . hoagie : i have an irresistible urge to kiss you , ellen brody . ellen : why ? hoagie : because ... it would not occur to you why . and if that 's not confusing enough for you , feast upon this nugget of dialogue , from a conversation between michael and ellen brody . ellen : why did you come out here ? why did you come out here ? michael : mom ! mom ! why did you take the boat ? ellen : it [the shark] kept coming ! michael : do n't you realize what you 're doing ? ellen : i 've tried to tell you , there was nothing else to do ! michael : mom , you should n't have done it . ellen : i 've tried to tell you , i 've tried ! joseph sargent 's directing is terrible ; it 's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing . which may be why the acting is so horrible . the highlight of the cast is lance guest , whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented michael caine 's by a longshot . the horrid acting is forgivable , however ; after all , how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd ? a film in which sharks roar , swim from new england to the bahamas to kill family members , and leap thirty feet out of the water ? on the plus side , jaws : the revenge is enormously fun to watch , thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity . it is very likely one of the worst films ever made - jaws 3-d looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there 's nothing else on tv some late night , grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is jaws : the revenge"
neg,"i 'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i ca n't decide among the following : * travels through guilt with the world 's 33rd richest hippie * the mind of an empty suit * a self-important revisionist history * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition . the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world , when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry . if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy , then the moral outrage of this book makes sense . but there 's a whole lot to swallow . on the plus side , it 's a fast and somewhat entertaining read . otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface . one of the things that i 've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny . as i look at the 20th century , i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation . he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america , rues the lives of poor peasants , and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism . perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist . a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric . but you ca n't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx , weber , engles , friere or anyone . back when i was a bit more blackified , i referred to such people as culture vultures . if it 's indigenous , it 's good . but you 'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics , literacy rates , crime rates or even inflation . i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil . technically , you 'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia . basically , perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet , his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is , was and always will be the american way . you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins , who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game . it 's a confession all right . by the time i got 2 / 3rds of the way through , reading the book began to become annoying . the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering . there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of . he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning . it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory . we learn that he took one of his charges ( female ) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean , but that when he got there , he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees . if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance , the best book i 've read is my life as a quant . if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy , the best book to read is larry kolb 's overworld . if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era , then this is your book . but it 's nowhere near as good as , say the quiet american . you can imagine that perkins , who is a great admirer of graham greene , might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen . he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus , but he is to honest to consider himself heroic , and i suspect that he 'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life . in that regard , ' confessions of an economic hitman ' is ( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition ) a blueprint for american liberal guilt . if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown , it is john perkins . he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american , down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine . you 'd think , being a pseudo-economist , that he 'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton . ahh but that would mean that he 'd have to admire courage . i did n't want to be a harsh judge of perkins . i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life , one of conviction and then epiphany . instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through . someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that ' corporatocray ' is evil . this book has been a disappointment in many ways . i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this . good parts ? yeah there are a few . he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders . he gives a few details about saudi aramco . but compared to larry kolb 's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi , this is romper room . if perkins thought he was an agent.. . do n't make me laugh"
neg,"the book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting . however , the author included a lot of details that just really did n't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts . the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book . my professor was able to bring dr. schrag to talk to our class . he was a good lecturer-keeping the class ' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro . if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style , i think he would have much more success as an author"

pos,"doug ritter and his foundation , equipped to survive , has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit . it is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket , yet fully functional . although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit ( something of a rite of passage among the survivalists / emergency preparedness folk ) , i spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit . the military issue sparklite and tinder-quick , fox-40 whistle , and rescue flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear . this pack is extremely high quality through and through , from choice of equipment to packing and instructions . i recommend looking at the ets website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what doug ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit ( the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs ) . the pocket survival pack is an amazing value . i 've purchased all of the items separately , and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost ! if you are lucky enough to get everything at one store , you 'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this . i know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits ! that 's how economical it is . plus , if you buy this psp , a portion of the proceeds goes to the ets non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards . in fact , doug ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine , aviation , and remote travel . the kit itself comes in a waterproof container . i found it to be a bit tight when closing back up , but there is actually some room for more items . all components are of the highest quality . it 's lightweight and i never notice it in a pocket . with the recommended ets or similar keychain led flashlight and a good pocket folding knife , you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. these are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping / hiking / marine / aviation gear you might have . i highly recommend this psp . i 'm not affiliated with ets , but i 've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums . and if this was a bad kit , i 'd still say so . i give it 5 stars , great value for the price and it really could save your life"
pos,"several tunes on ' back to oakland ' feature tower of power at their best . one in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track , ' squib cakes' . featured soloists include a short , mellow guitar solo from bruce conte , followed by greg adams ' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range ( leading one to believe it 's a trombone ! ) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish . tenor madness abounds from lead saxman lenny pickett ( known primarily for his work as lead tenor for the saturday night live band ) , wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range ( jazz musicians call these ' freak notes ' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ) , while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout . chester thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in la in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer . lyrical yet hard-driving , thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant ' squib cakes ' , then takes off on his own flight , delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though bach suddenly had learned some jazz hammond himself . in the middle of the solo , as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove , thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand , chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left , that in the days of hearing this on vinyl , i wondered if my record was skipping through that section ! to finish the groove , at the end of thompson 's solo , the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets . after he closes , we 're back to the head to close out the tune . even with so much to savor , this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more , even after the final stroke of the last chord . the musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album 's other tunes . i have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time i spin it . i recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore tower of power 's "" sound .

pos,"let 's face it , tinseltown has run out of original story lines . that 's usually when they turn to remakes . i 've seen several remakes over the years , both tv and movie , but this is one of the best remakes i 've seen in quite some time . i really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line . what a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the tv show and pulled all of it 's story from the comic book . if you were never into comics to begin with then you ca n't appreciate the story line . another thing that i feel is under appreciated about this movie is the cgi . people have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time ! the amount of man hours that went in to creating the cgi is something to be applauded and appreciated , not mocked and thrown out with the trash . you have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value . most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it . the story of the hulk is a sad , depressing , dramatic story ! there is n't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something . the hulk was n't meant to be campy , it was meant to be serious . my only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play banner 's love interest . the little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted"

pos,"this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era , that of border radio . brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas / mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america - one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio . these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an ' x' . this spawned an industry of singers , politicians , preachers and pitchman the type we now see on & quot ; infomercials&quot ; . mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you & quot ; pulled&quot ; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - & quot ; keep those cards and letters coming ! & quot ; new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev . ike - & quot ; get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo ! & quot ; this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio , salesmanship , and american sub-cultures and the bizarre"
neg,"i was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera . i had hoped the ultra-wide photos ( which was my main reason for going with this camera ) also would be ultra sharp , but instead they tended to be soft . the camera has a lag time of about 1 / 10th of a second , so it 's more of a point , shoot and wait camera . the v705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints , but do n't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras . in my opinion , the camera squeezes too much out of a jpeg photo by way of compression and shooting tif files just is n't practical . i demand better image quality from my cameras and , when zooming in , i like to see detail . i certainly do n't like everything going soft ."

neg,"you know , i actually enjoyed the first mummy . it was funny , the idea , not often seen in modern films , was good , and the characters were each , in their own way , entertaining to watch . why , god , why did they have to go and make a sequel ? i do n't understand . was it for the money ? ? ? i 'm not sure when exactly i began to hate this ; maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake again . really , you 'd think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it 's thousand-year rest they 'd learn their lesson . but oh , no ; the first time was n't enough . and , also , the whole having a kid thing , did n't seem to work . the relationship between the characters was n't the same anymore . i hate it when they do that in movies : make sequels and give the once-cool , main characters children . nothing against it , just felt wrong for this movie . throughout most of this movie , i felt stupid , and i do n't like for things to make me feel that way . i also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater . maybe it 's just me ; i just did n't like it . question of the day for american cinema : what 's the deal with being obsessed with sequels ? ? ? ? ? come on , the first was good enough . you know what the worst thing is ? -i was actually looking forward to seeing this"
pos,"i had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the canon eos1. as exploration health , safety & environment advisor , work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans . the wait was for 35mm film quality , with speed of picture taking ( 5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the eos 1 was desired ) . there was a parallel wait for an image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let 's cut the story short . if i want a camera to bring on holiday , it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky ; instead i would choose the eos20d without hesitation . but having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames i decided not to wait any longer but to buy the eos1d mark ii because the 1ds mark ii is not fast enough at 4 frames a second . with 35mm cameras , after a few seconds on the shooting , i would have to run back inside to the cabin ( of a ship ) to change film . if there is large enough memory card in the eos1dii , there is no need . this camera is built with seals against the environment ( and so does the 28-300mm lens ) . instead of being scared of running out of film , now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning ( and hoping ) the dolphins do their jumps into the air . with the 28-300mm lens attached , there is no need to change lenses either . dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting . it is a disappointment that the battery is not lion but the older nimh . but as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare , whatever the substance . i just wish canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky . it has connections for two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following the other ) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged . you just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps.......ext . hard disk....as hand luggage . for work , i am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware . but for holidays , i would choose the eos20d with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod ? the camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one of the beauties i had thought with digital slr was not having to do anything in processing , just transfer the images to the computer . wrong . the .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough . post processing is required . why ? why is that necessary when the canon s60 ( which i use for different assignments ( with underwater housing ) ) does n't need to ? that defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 meg when the 1.5 meg of the s60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? still , there is raw if the standard output is not suficient . incidentally , the eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg .jpg and those also require post processing . for those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem a bit wasted . i am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process , and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film . meantime i shall have to learn to shoot with raw files and post process . also incidentally , the sensor size of the eos20d is smaller , which means although itself is lighter than the eos1d series camera , having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday . the magnification ratio for the eos1dii is 1.3 whereas the eos20d is 1.6. this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) with the 1dii and 28-135mm is lens attached . sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it is state of the technology at the moment . another benefit of using digital is that , it does n't matter if you had been shooting iso 100 all day . come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop , just change to iso 1600 without having to bother about "" pushing2 the film in developing . it 's a beauty when an is l lens is attached . you 'd need is when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! good job canon . now you need to shoe horn in a more capable cpu ( to process the images in-camera ) , fit the 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1dsii and you may persuade me to part with more cash ."

neg,"i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times . i got to around page 20 or so . i 'll probably try again . however , if you 're an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you 'll know what objectivism is about . i would n't suggest it for teens that have n't had any prior readings , though . objectivism is about the self and about "" reason "" , and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else . the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous . i assume that 's in my head , but judge for yourself . her caricatures of "" the witch doctor "" ( who controls others from a spiritual perspective ) and "" attila "" ( who controls by brute force ) are actually interesting . wrong , but interesting . since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival ( or think they do , anyway ) , it 's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book . my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand ( she 's not wrong on everything ) , or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills . judging by previous reviews , it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers . if you buy into it , you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way . if you do n't buy into it , however , you 're evil ( either the witch doctor or attila ) and probably just too stupid to "" get it "" . why i did n't finish it yet.. . i just could n't get past her ignorance of history , frankly . if you 're writing a work of fiction , the historical innacuracies do n't matter , but this is n't supposed to be fiction . i like history and most people do n't , so it probably wo n't bother most people . also , while she denounces religion , ms. rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself . like all other religions and cults , the world is messed up basically because people do n't think like she does ."

pos,"i am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university . as such , i am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general . i really like neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality . for most people , i think it offers great protection , but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer . according to my dermatologist , recent studies have shown that spf 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and does n't offer adequate protection after that time . this is partly due to most people not using enough . in other words , they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection . for this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 is better . also , the neutrogena ultra sheer products have been updated to include a technology called helioplex . most dermatologists that i know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important . i have used both this product and the higher spf helioplex formulations . in practice , i have found both adequate for my needs . what i particularly like is that you do n't even know you have the product on . it has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you ca n't even notice it . both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use , but my understanding is that the helioplex formulation is even better . further , it feels exactly the same on the skin . the only drawback is it 's a bit more expensive . this is also a good product because it protects against both uva and uvb rays . both are implicated in skin cancer and it 's important to protect yourself against both . if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one . however , if you want the very best protection try the neutrogena helioplex spf 55. this will give you the most peace of mind"

pos,"after using this software for a week , i 'm generally pleased with the results . the learning curve is not too difficult to climb ; though i have some prior experience with less sophisticated versions of this type of software . the box comes with a thick printed manual , which is nice to have for reference . the index in the manual is good but not great . unfortunately the manual is not comprehensive . it appears to cover the core functionality but does not have any depth to its discussion of "" power tools "" . the manual appears to be a nearly verbatim copy of the online help . the software comes with short online instructional videos - - basically animated screen captures with voice-over commentary . the two or three videos that i 've watched have filled in the gaps that the manual left open . my pc has a 2001-era 1ghz celeron and 1gb of memory . it renders the 3d drawings fast enough to not be frustrating , and i have limited patience for this sort of thing . however , i have not added great amounts of detail to the plan yet - - mostly just walls , roof , electrical , and some trim . the addition of detail may slow rendering down enough to be annoying . other reviewers have complained about performance , but the documentation has hints for speeding up if you run into problems . while the core parts of the software are pretty good , the power tools leave a little something to be desired . this may just be a lack of education on my part , but if so then i 'm going to blame the skimpy documentation . these power tools almost appear to have been developed by either different groups or by third parties . overall they lack the polish and usability that is part of the core software . take the "" room wizard "" , for example . this is a slick way to put together the interior floor plan of the house . the problem is that the room wizard launches almost as a separate application , and when you 're done it asks to "" update the current design "" . when you say yes , it appears to paste the picture drawn in the room wizard back into the main application . from there , it is difficult ( impossible ? ) to get the interior layout to overlay your foundation design . i had difficulty with other power tools : the topo designer is clunky , the site planner has an annoying lot size limitation ( no line can be more than 1000 ' ) , the estimator wo n't let you add additional materials ( you can put in the cost of concrete for your foundation , but you ca n't add fill or stone for drainage ; if i have to manually put this stuff into a separate spreadsheet then having a built-in estimator is pointless ) . and so on . again , maybe this is a learning thing , but the rest of the software is easy to figure out - - why are these so different ? overall , i would give the software 3.5 stars : four stars for doing the stuff it absolutely must do very well , minus one star for advertising extras that do n't work so good , plus a star for good documentation on the core functionality , minus half a star for failing to document the extras . ( i figure that the extra thirty to fifty bucks of cost over competing brands is due to these extras , but i have n't tried the competition ."

neg,"the plot of this book was interesting , and it could have been a good book . unfortunately , it wasn't . the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable , and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem ! even many of the the secondary characters are weak , miserable people ! the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a "" dirty little nobody "" . once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful , he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards . because she is the daughter of a "" cit "" , he ca n't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal . he says charming things to her like "" how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway "" . now that 's romance ! meanwhile , even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times , she finds herself drawn to him too . for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim . she never stood up for herself , and you felt sorry for her . of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage.. . only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter , including her . in fact just about the only one who does n't know is the hero , which provides the dilemma . he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really was n't a nobody ! will anyone tell him ? will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she is n't good enough for him ? will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he does n't think she is good enough for him to marry ? of course it all works out , and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him . ugh ! ! ! this could have been a good book if the "" mystery "" had been handled better , and the characters were written differently . as is , it is a sad regency tale"

pos,"this is one of the best camcorders in the market today and i would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a mini-dv camcorder positive factors : - very small and easy to hold with one hand . can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease . - excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio . your videos finally get that "" hollywood "" feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you do n't have a widescreen tv currently , you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them . so its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) - good battery life . one extra battery is enough . you can easily manage a day 's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or tv . if you have a good computer with a firewire port , please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer . you can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit ( instead of the default 12 bit ) for very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system is great . you do n't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos . anything more produces more "" shaking "" and would necessiate the use of a tripod . when you shoot without a tripod , 10x is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - widescreen still photo . the photo clarity is ok not too good . so please do n't expect great shots . since the photo is in 16:9 format , you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - nightshot : cool feature that records using infrared light . useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder . the color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the lcd in clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed . so please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors . add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best to turn off the button click "" beep "" sound ) . notes : - use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette . the head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - you can edit movies in windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but movie maker converted it to 4:3. invest in pinnacle software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle is the only software , i am aware of , that preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage"

pos,"dvd #1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise . it hits both the high - and lowpoints , and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history . lambeau , hutson , lombardi , starr , nitschke , the ice bowl , favre , white , the nine nfl championships , the three super bowls they won ( i , ii , and xxxi ) , and the one they lost ( xxxii ) . the best fans in the league , the smallest venue , the most legendary stadium , and the team 's miraculous survival over 80+ years , in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans . the highpoint , of course , is the 15-minute section entitled "" lombardi "" which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl 's greatest coach- -but at the end of this dvd about the packers ' heroic ongoing history , you realize that as great as lombardi was , the team is greater still . dvd #2 was produced earlier in vhs format ( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb ) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history . other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants . yes , kramer was offside- -but luck is a part of any game , and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter . like another reviewer , i love the postgame interviews , even the glimpses of green bay in 1967. the muted colors of the frigid game ( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s- -i see the same thing in footage of other games ) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed ."

neg,"there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film , but as a whole it just did n't quite work for me . vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character : fanda , a maddening yet adorable grandpa , oh-so-young-at-heart , oh-so-mischievious and impish , but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you ca n't help loving him warts and all . in fact , that 's one of the fatal flaws of this movie : the lack of any dark side to any of the characters . they 're all basically harmless walt disney types , even the bumbling and self-absorbed son . there are no real consequences to brodsky 's actions other than stella ( his wife ) finally talking divorce but it 's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she 'll come back to him . there is no center , no force or dynamic power in this film- --it 's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do n't want to hurt the feelings of your host . the ending also relies on another lazy device , the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice / supporter of fanda 's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable . this film might 've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda 's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death , instead of focusing on how clever , audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is , which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse , narcissism . one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr. brodsky , who is a towering figure among czech actors , that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him . a more accurate title for this movie , especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll , might be : "" the fantasy life of a poor old man .

pos,"this camera is simply amazing ! i started out with a canon g2 , and then a canon g6 , and then a canon 20d , and now this canon 1d mark ii n . i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii , 5d , and 30d . my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n . yes , i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i 'm 110% glad that i did . for me , this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , and the 1d pro body / interface / menu / layout , etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor . trust me , if you do n't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is , you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide . because of this 8.5fps alone , i 'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it...no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc. as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo ."

neg,"i thought i was getting a look into jay-z 's and roc-a-fellas world . maybe a documentary i thought ? maybe a movie i thought ? instead this was the worst attempt at a movie , video whatever they called it ever . this thing is horrible . the only good part is jay z rapping the scenarios he is in . thats cool for like 2 mins . at times its like a porn video . i wanted to get into jiggas world but all this dvd did was make the world a worse place to live in because of how horrible it is . the crap sets in again over and over all across the plate . even the biggest hova fans should stay away . dont buy this"
pos,"this is a very flexible and capable camera . if you are looking for more than a point & shoot will offer , there are very few that would compare . for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle , if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing . the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature . the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied"
neg,"this product offers much to chose from and i really liked the photos . however , i have yet to get this program to work right . i am able to view the photos but when i go into the the export wizard to save the photos , the photo has a transparency over the top of it , instead of in the background . i tried bypassing the export wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving . this also inserts the transparency over the photo . i called hemera in canada and they instructed me to call encore usa in ca for support . encore usa said they could n't help me . encore 's technical support is "" limited to crashes , error messages and lockups "" . i also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or faq's . there was very little about this software and no help to be found . i wasted my money on a product i ca n't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control ."
pos,"very convenient reading glasses . you could hang them on your neck when not using them , and not even notice they are there . they are very sturdy , and are flexible making them almost imposible to break . cons : both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side . they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face . the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair , as the glasses would trap your hair against your face"
neg,"chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again . fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions . nicks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older ' pop ' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days...no , we 're not saying recycle the older productions , but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and ' originality ' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey , it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes , how the mighty have fallen.. . oh brother. ."
neg,"filled with bizarre generalizations , and the most pretentious phraseology i 've seen in years , this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years . jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture , history , politics , or even writing style . it seems she should have spent more time with turabian 's manual for writers , than surfing the web or watching sienfeld"
pos,vhs - i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer . i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever . make up your own mind and do n't let others put you off ! i have all jane austen 's bbc series but this is my favourite . angie london englan
pos,"my only reccomendation would be a better user interface , it can be a bit confusing . the underlying functions work well though"
neg,this book disappointed me after reading martins letters . although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity . there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez .

neg,"but for "" the drugs do n't work , "" which is marginal at best , this album is boring...cookie-cutter , nothing original"
pos,"i saw this movie twice , the second time knowing exactly why i wanted to see it again . if you are trying to find out if you love someone or not , make sure that you see this movie . such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives . explains why we are where we are , and makes you part of the harmony . is love as simple as teaching someone to bike ? think about it . if there are no rules against it , this film should be renominated for oscar ."
neg,"i understand why so many people like dido..she is beautiful , has a decent voice , comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...this album is the same - ' inoffensive' ...some might say , bland...the tracks that work for me are ' thank you ' ( used on eminem 's ' stan ' ) , but is done solo here and it works , ' hunter ' and ' here with me' ...the rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...nothing much happens , nothing inspires...i really want to like her , but it 's all been done before. ."
pos,registry mechanic is a great registry tool . it works better than the registry tools included with symantec system works . if you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product . try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
neg,gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great . i just want to point out that the double-cd ' best of ' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price . there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import
neg,"i remember when this recording came out and wynton marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz . i picked it up right away . i was mystified by the souless mimicry of art blakey 's jazz messengers and miles ' 2nd great quintet- -this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz ? listen as wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements , stopping on a dime ! marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars ! ! gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of think of one that strips the tune of any semblence of swing ! ! ! i get it , wynton- -you 've mastered the trumpet , technically speaking , which is no mean feat . and you can read music . bully for you . the only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say . ordinarily , i 'd feel sorry for you , having wasted all those hours of practice , except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you are n't worthy of washing . people like john coltrane , joe zawinul , miles davis , wayne shorter , herbie hancock...i could go on and on , but i think you get the point . this music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber , thus killing it ."
pos,"the hard-copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries , now you can have all of that , with video , audio , tons of photos , and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original . for what you get , it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library"
neg,the information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids . it is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem .
pos,"i own an older dispensor , from around 1999 , and i was afraid that these filters would n't fit . they do and seem to work fine . i ca n't find a "" replace "" indicator on these new ones , the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them . i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis , they say the filters are good for 2 months"
pos,"i just got my new photo box today . i was so excited i opened it at work . then i took a picture of my wendy 's salad just to see how it looked . the quality of the pictures are excellent ( macro mode ) . light is evenly distributed . caution about the lights : the lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them on . i suggest for the shear sanctity of safety , shut off the lights between object / scene changes . the package arrived intact , the box was beat up a little , nothing major . when i opened the item , i noticed the camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom . this could 've been a bad / weak stitch , or may have happened during shipping , but nothing major was wrong , only that . besides , i can sew it ! overall , this is a great product , and is easy to setup and carry around . i 'd definitely buy again"
neg,"i have owned eleven vcom products and from now on , they do n't have my business . the product touts itself in part as a vital tool when / if your machine crashes . if it does , be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program . you are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you ca n't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you ca n't get through via phone...what you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 is also much slower than version 5. support for 5.0 , by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out , despite the functionality of that program . for the price , the software should work like a major player , rather than a dollar bin special ."
neg,"i was deeply disappointed by the so-called & quot ; return of the funk&quot ; with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup . as compared to herbie hancock 's original & quot ; headhunters&quot ; release , the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient , the grease . this recent release has traded the & quot ; grits and gravy&quot ; created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers , for over-produced smooth jazz-funk , complete with overused n'dea davenport r&amp ; b hooks that left this album flat"
pos,"this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian , which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace . so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite . we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form , political arm , and unloving attitude . this book is a real insight into the christian faith of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals , especially those who were not self righteous , but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives ."
pos,"this is a great cd ! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end . this makes it nice to just play the entire cd or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another . so far the car and washing machine tracks seem to be our baby 's favorites . when she outgrows the need for this white noise cd , we 'll transition her to lullaby or classical music . for now though , this cd helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times . as a bonus , the waves and rain on the roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep"
neg,"when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra / cleopatra with a "" k "" - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character - essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n't work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit.. . unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george ."
neg,this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen . it takes colossal gall ( to say nothing of immense bad taste ) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices . all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original . the acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn . i got this just to see the great luise rainer . now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed

pos,"not a bad product . irritates the skin a little , but does remove your hair . the only things i do n't like is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back with in 2 weeks . it does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and is great for hard to reach places . not a bad product ; however , i hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away permanently or for a longer period of time . i would recommend this product"

pos,"these are all short stories , some very short ; that 's what he wrote . i remember reading a number of these ( the science fiction ones mostly ) in translation years ago . rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting . as a collection of all his fictions , some of the items are a bit repetitive ; the variations on the "" knife fight "" theme for instance . but the range of his imagination is fascinating , particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity : a lot of it presages the information-based world of today , which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind . perhaps the link to the internet is one reason borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles . is not the web exactly borges ' "" book of sand "" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information , but when we turn to find them again , we never can ? and how long will it be before an imagined "" orbis tertius "" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on ( one might suggest it 's already happened - look up tatooine , for instance.. . ) what exactly is information when it 's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything 's already been written in the "" library of babel "" after all ! the other fascinating thread to me was the influence of arabic and muslim themes ; i 'd never caught that before , but this collection includes a number of stories with an arab perspective . perhaps this is a well-known part of spanish heritage ; in any case , it was certainly interesting getting to know borges through this collection , from the knife fights to the arabian courts to the immortals - not everything was great , but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with"

neg,jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end . the only mystery is in the details . no real suspense . i found the plot to be a little farfetched
neg,"this cd has some good songs on it , but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected . they are mixed together , and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs , buy this , but i would n't recommend it otherwise"
pos,del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently.. . the beats of songs merge together as tracks change.. . el-p makes a cameo.. . casual makes a cameo.. . prince paul produces a track.. . get this album
pos,"this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front . across the region known as flanders , three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains . this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed . it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians , the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling , bombing , machine gun fire , gas attacks and wretched weather conditions . in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down . it is a shame so many historians , including such military writers as david glantz , do not emulate groom 's style"
neg,"i am a jane austen fan . i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel . however , mansfield park is jane austen 's most complex and serious novel , and on the whole it is my favorite . fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines , not the wittiest or most beautiful , but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong . she is mentored by her uncle , the righteous and honorable [and i do n't use the terms loosely] sir thomas bertram . somehow , the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic , sexual pervert . moreover , fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel . they simply missed the point of the book . the acting is okay . the settings are okay . the directing is sad . but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste"
neg,"i bought this with the notion that i would be receiving what was pictured : the filters that have a built in replacement gauge . oops ! what i ended up with was the cheaper , replace every two month whether they need it or not filters . oh well , whats a little customer service when there 's a buck to be made . not like it 's false advertising to send people a cheaper product then what they thought they were getting"
neg,"i love a lot of b movie horror , but this not that great.i thought it would be better having gunner hanson in it , and gordon lewis , the story line was ok.the gore wasnt there , little sceens of it.again i thought there would be more ( shockorama ) anyways if your thinking about getting it , i would first rent it.see if you like it , i wouldnt waste your money on the full price dvd.the music score was cool for sure"
pos,"richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout ( along with partner emilio estevez ) of pretty madeleine stowe ( they have to watch her house through the night ) , and he falls in love with her . before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer ( aidan quinn ) . it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie , but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target . a very entertaining movie ; definitely worth a watch"
pos,"this book started off very slowly for me . i got pretty tired of the gender bending deception - how could she be so stupid as to think he was stupid enough to believe his charade for that long in that close of company ? ? ? once the air was cleared , the book picked up speed and ended quite well . i give the book 4 stars because it did cause me to shed a few tears at one point . all in all , a very enjoyable read . past about the halfway point"

pos,i am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera . i 've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots . the winding mechanism is easy to use . finally i have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember . it 's even suited for kids over ten to use . mine had lots of fun with their own quick snap
neg,"weird , whacked out interpretation of lewis carroll 's alice in wonderland that combines live-action with some stop-action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape . white rabbit is a sawdust-stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand , caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes , mad hatter is a marionette and march hare is a wind-up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye . devoted alice fans may have a different reaction , but i found jan svankmajer 's alice disturbing and , at times , tedious . everyday objects - the stuff in alice 's room - become the stuff of the dream . playing cards become red queen and entourage , the white rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts , alice herself becomes her own blank-faced doll . there 's no law that says alice has to be bright and cuddly , but it sure helps . whether intentional or not , svankmajer 's alice is grim and nightmarish . svankmajer animates figures in motion - real figures , like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such - but he does n't animate facial expressions . combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film 's narrator - alice is narrated by the actress who plays alice , dubbed into english , or course - and the film has a flat , dead feeling . the film , oddly enough for an animated feature , is leadenly paced . some scenes seem to run on forever . the tea party with the mad hatter ( a marionette ) and the march hare ( a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill-attached button eye ) runs on and on , the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience . the mad hatter wants a new cup of tea ( ` change chairs ! ' ) , the march hare scoots around in a wheelchair . the new seats are taken , the tea is poured , the mad hatter wants a news cup of tea ( ` change chair ! ' ) and on , and on , and on . sheesh - thought that scene would never end . look - i 'm not that big a fan of carroll 's alice stories in the first place , but the movie adaptations of his stories - be they disney 's animated movie or the 1933 full-length feature with ned sparks as the catepillar and sterling holloway as the frog - all have had something going for them . comedy , for one thing . svankmajer 's inspiration is laudable , but his execution is often disappointing . his alice is dark , grim , humorless and not everyone 's cup of chai . it 's like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band - it 's familiar enough , probably good enough for the converted , but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans ."
pos,i usually do n't do album reviews but i gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call & quot ; the sauce&quot ; so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings . word of mouth is bliss . a-g-2-a-ke who came out on rap-a-lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic . i 'm salty they did n't & quot ; make it&quot ; because this was heavily slept on
pos,this was a very interesting movie . a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key . i think i liked the skeleton key better.. . but this was still a really good movie . there are a few scenes with nudity in it . not a movie for the youngsters . we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end . a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing
neg,"i 've always been a fan of roger moore 's james bond , but what i 've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were , like , actually good . "" the spy who loved me "" is not one of them . oh , sure , it 's fun - - almost all of the bond flicks are fun - - but it 's basically just a kid 's movie , and that 's not necessarily a good thing . ( 1 ) stromberg is a lame villain . yes , his underwater lair is well-designed , but it 's silly . not as silly as that ice palace in "" die another day , "" but pretty silly . ( 2 ) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls . she 's not an ugly woman , to be sure , but she was a terrible actress ; she sounds like she 's reading - - poorly - - from a cue card in ever single scene she 's in . ( 3 ) jaws is a stupid character . having metal teeth would n't actually make you capable of biting through metal . the metal you were biting would resist , and you 'd end up just tearing up your gums . i do n't expect realism from 007 movies , but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic . ( that said , jaws is effectively used , and richard kiel was excellent in the role . ) ( 4 ) the disco score is terrible . terrible . ( 5 ) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of "" you only live twice , "" but on the ocean rather than in space . certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies ! embarrassing . i love bond , but this is not one of the highlights . the dvd is good , with a couple of fine documentaries , but the commentary track grates , because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did . even if that were true , it 'd be annoying"
neg,"the book starts off ok with a good introduction of the various api 's and is ok reading up untill chapter 6 "" programming linux audio "" . this is where the book fails terribly . none of the audio samples will compile and the information about openal is just plain wrong . first the function used to open a wav file is no the corerct function to use for linux . the author uses the win32 version . this is just the start of the openal errors . minus one star ! second the book 's two websites ( one of which no longer exists ( loki ) ) contains no errata and no way to contact the author . the only information is avalible is a zip file of the books sample files ( which do not compile of course ) . minus two stars ! ohter things about the book that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses c instead of c++. while c is still used for game development , most programmers are attempting to migrate to c++ and ood . books released about 1950 should reflect that ! second the author uses tcl as a game scripting engine . while i can agree to a point ( based on the fact of the easy of implementation ) the author should have used a common scripting engine such as lua . ( although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea . third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter 10. the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general . the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good ( assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms ) . also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro ."

neg,"i admit that i 'm far from an expert on digital cameras . i did take over 32 , 000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years . i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005. it was n't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work . i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them . i can understand them saying , ' we 'll charge you at first , but once we establish that the fault is due to us , we 'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera ( in the mail ) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back . ( i also emailed them the same request ) . neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon 's behalf . that in itself was enough for me and i 've been bitter about that ever since . i 've also told every person that i 've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident . i 'm pleased to say , i 've steered most away from this company . what else can i say about this camera : this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture . i 've missed out on some good shots due to this . it eats batteries like there 's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa 's to even make this camera worth its while . i 've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie ( with this camera ) in my home during the day and go outside , most things outside are very white . almost like looking at an infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during the day , everything is dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras are this way ? i would n't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think about that . you have to pay the shipping for a camera that 's barely a few months old and still under warranty . that 's disgusting , that 's all i have to say . there should be a zero for this , not a 1 star"
neg,"a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one . that 's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible . there was only one direction they could go - - up . it 's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp . i said this about the young , fly , & flashy album , and the same applies here , so i 'll say it again : when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow , your album is in serious trouble . but let me balance that statement though . this is n't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics . this is simple , bass heavy , crunk music . it 's effective in it 's purpose , but it 's totally generic ( the recipe for most party songs ) . and some of these songs are just flat out horrible . "" stop callin ' me "" is n't only horrible , but it is n't about anything if you 're paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it ( and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped ) . and who 's idea was it to let dame dash ( yeah , that dame dash ) scream all over a song ( bricks 4 the high ) ? i want to know who the guy was that said "" yeah , that 's a good idea "" . dame is doing what he does best , so he 's not at fault.....i blame the idiot that put him on the song . "" suckas come and try me "" is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album . and if you ask me , the "" white tee "" remix was a step backward from the original . it would help if they could talk about something other than "" haters "" , postin ' up on the block ( i swear they say that on the album at least 100 times ) , rims , jewelry , and weed . but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess . besides , if people buy this , why should they change ? that 's another story though . in short , the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack . the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ( "" i 'll make you 1 2 step like ciara "" ? come on , i could write that in my sleep ) and it 's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar . once you understand the purpose of this album though , then you can find a few decent tracks , but do n't go getting your hopes up just yet . there are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing . "" my music "" is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b 's good appearance . the best beats on the album are on "" do n't play with me "" feat . three six mafia and "" freaky as she wanna be "" . "" do n't play with me "" features production from dj paul & juicy j , so you know it 's tight . i love three six , so that 's my favorite song on the album . and "" freaky as she wanna be "" will be the second single off the album if they 're smart . on top of our game is good for what it 's supposed to be good for ( partying and....well , that 's it ) , but not much else . jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant , but i do n't know if this approach is gonna help him any . this album is better than their debut , but that 's not really saying much . this should be pretty obvious , but i 'll say it anyway . if you 're into lyrics , then this is n't for you . if you want crunk beats to bounce to , then this is right up your alley . it depends on your preference , but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one . standout tracks : freaky as she wanna be , i think they like me ( remix ) feat . jd , da brat , & bow wow , do n't play wit me feat . three six mafia ( my favorite ) , and my music feat . bun b ."

pos,"yes , ben witherington is a ( relative ) conservative , but do n't hold that against him . yes , he has strong opinions , but do n't hold that against him , either , because they are well argued . the fact remains that this is the best overview of & quot ; third quest&quot ; jesus scholarship i have been able to find . admirers of the jesus seminar may not appreciate his critique , but it is very fair and well-thought out . one of the benefits from a book like this , besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research , is that the different views of jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the savior . no one scholar gets it right all the time ( not even witherington , with his own view of jesus as god 's wisdom ) , but the different insights are valuable , because jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend . that should be a cause for humility ( something some jesus scholars have lacked , at least in print ) . i highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary jesus scholarship"
pos,"i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless . i think it easily earns 4.5 - 5 stars . it is over a decade old now , and i do n't think it is intended as a source for scholars of english . but , for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read . i ca n't compete with some of the above reviewer 's scholarly points , but i do n't think replacing some of bryson 's dogma with their own is worthwhile . mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational .

pos,"i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit . i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike . i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another . first on the matter of tape drive noise : yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear . but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer . second , they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer . what they do n't tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable ( about $70.00 total at best buy ) . you cannot simply hook up through the available computer usb port . fortunately , microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called "" moviemaker "" . i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit , i think it is a bargain . finally , i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out . your thumb easily controls on / off and tape transport functions . it is really easy to use , at least for right handed users . all considered , i am satisfied with the product . of course , if it dies next week , i will have a different opinion"

pos,"i once read an article in horn book magazine ( a review source of titles and articles on children 's literature ) that lamented the millions of poor translations of hans christian andersen polluting the minds of our young people today . the review mentioned that stories like , "" the snow queen "" , which were originally written in a snappy vernacular , have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their american translators . with this idea fresh in my mind i found myself in possession of a very particular copy of "" the snow queen "" and i was able to test this theory myself . now due to the wacky nature of amazon.com , the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this anderson story . you will see that some of the reviews refer to nilesh mistry 's , some refer to the audio book , some to eileen kernaghan 's , and some ( god help us all ) to mary engelbreit . none of these , however , are the version that i am reviewing . after careful consideration , i selected the edition retold by amy ehrlich and illustrated by susan jeffers . the ehrlich / jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from thumbelina to cinderella . with this 1982 classic edition , they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of andersen 's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life . most people do n't remember that "" the snow queen "" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad . by a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day ( the details of this accident are left unclear ) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere . if these splinters enter your eye , everything will look ugly to you . if they enter your heart , it will turn instantly to ice . got it ? good . cause sure enough , two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named kai . when this happens he stops playing with his best playmate gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale snow queen . gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures . she escapes an overly loving old witch , is taken in by a prince and princess , falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin , and at last saves kai from the snow queen herself . by the end of the book , neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it . obviously "" the snow queen "" is one big ole story about growing up . the idea of the devil 's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart.. . well that 's just another way of describing adolescence , is it not ? andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale , "" east of the sun , west of the moon "" , in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman . heck , "" tam lin "" was probably an influence as well . the best version of this particular story i ever read was by kara dalkey . it was a tale named , "" the lady of the ice garden "" and can be found in "" firebirds : an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy "" . it is not , however , appropriate for children . kids today will probably look at "" the snow queen "" and instantly think of the white witch from "" the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe "" . i cannot think , however , that this is a bad thing . as for the jeffers / ehrlich version , it 's all right . as an illustrator , jeffers has apparently decided to make kai and gerta definitely children . i guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the snow queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs . jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the snow queen 's dress and every strand of her white white hair . there is the odd stylistic choice here and there , though . when gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed , it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals . i ca n't think that they 're comfortable ( or even particularly practical ) . the illustrations have been created , according to the book , "" using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes . they were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased "" . as a result , the book is as soft as a colored pencil , but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink . obviously i do n't know enough about the original version of "" the snow queen "" ( or , as andersen called it , "" sneedronningen "" ) to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots . at any rate , it tells the full story , warts and all , and will provide them with what may well be the most freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains . a fun edition of a rather odd tale"

pos,"i would like to add to the reviews already posted , especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 vr . this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens , but have not been able to bring myself to do it . the 80-400 is 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , and has yet to be updated with vrii technology . all that , and it still costs more than the pro-quality canon 100-400 is , which has canon 's af-s equivalent too ! that said , i like long yet portable lenses , and after giving myself fits decided to "" settle "" for the 70-300 because it has vrii and af-s . if you are in the same boat then buy this lens , it is a gem for its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open at 300 , and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures . i would have loved this lens if it was an f / 3.5 , but even at 4.5-5.6 i have really been surprised at the results . save the $1000+ until nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur"
pos,"of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore & quot ; grossout&quot ; humor ( vomit-related , etc. ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print / transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release- -i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy"

pos,"this is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the bill evans trio . this was i 'm told bill 's first all ballads record . riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962. none of the music sounds dated . considering it 's 41 years old . this is the first recording bill made with chuck israels taking over for the late scott lafaro as the bass player . this album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it . the music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection . one goal that bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original sounding jazz . i dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording . to me it sounds more like european classical music . also thank god for bill 's college music theory teacher at southeastern university gretchen magee . because if it werent for her motivation {evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition "" very early "" {which is the last track on the cd its just breathtaking...}being an amature pianist myself , "" very early "" and "" childrens play song "" were the first two evans ' compositions i taught myself to play . the piece is a composition played in c major at a slow waltz tempo . he played the tune until the end of his life in 1980 , but the original version on "" moonbeams "" might be the all around finest one . it is given a very slow and delicate treatment , and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow falling gently around you . i also really like his interpretation of "" it might as well be spring "" . i think that bill evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that . he didnt play anything he didnt have to . he always played just the right amount of notes and chords . with this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement . evans once told tony bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on "" truth and beauty .

neg,"first off , let me say that i know next to nothing about art . i would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork , but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art . dali , however , is a master i at least have some affinity with . who does n't know of the melting clocks ? i have also seen the dream sequence he created for hitchcock 's film spellbound in 1945. plus , the guy was just plain weird , and that is something i know a little bit about myself . this artists of the 20th century dvd looks solely at dali 's artwork . all you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another . there is no biographical look at the man , no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings , and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality ( or mustache ) . there is not even an adequate identification of gala , his inspiration and muse , despite numerous references to her in his paintings . thus , this dvd will not introduce you to dali the man or dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro . dali 's artwork is obviously impressive , and i was surprised by the variety of his work and styles . the narrator offers insight into some paintings - others , you just look and advance . i do n't understand a lot of dali 's work , nor can i see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces . the melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me . dark works such as visage of war speak volumes to the human observer , and the disappearing bust of voltaire paintings are also striking . i was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces dali painted , however - largely because i did not know he ever produced such works . my idea of a painting equates with something like design for the interior decoration of a stable-library , which is a strikingly beautiful work . is this dvd worth watching ? i will have to say no . if you 're a know-nothing novice like me , there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown . if you 're knowledgeable about dali , you 'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite dali works excluded from the show . after watching this , i decided to peruse some dali galleries online , and i must say that the internet makes this dvd of little value . not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video , the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the dvd"

neg,"i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it , and being through with it now , i feel as though i 've learned very little . i had so many problems with this book , or rather the way of writing , mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author , that this was a difficult read . in his defense , he is , in most things , very thorough . my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was ( or as he sometimes put it & quot ; must have been&quot ; ) thinking or feeling . while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject , in my opinion , that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views . since he himself stresses that leonardo 's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings , he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations . in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo 's life , the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter , but only puts forward his own opinion , and his reasons why he believes what he does , without explaining the opposite side of the matter . in this manner , he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter . sentences beginning with & quot ; i think&quot ; or & quot ; in my view&quot ; are not uncommon . he also makes certain assumptions about the reader , referring often to other artists ' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them . also , he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo 's , often drawing attention to coloring or texture , without ever showing it , though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout . the author is an undoubtedly intelligent , well-learned man , very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned , but entirely overbearing in his writing . overall , unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and do n't mind being pulled out of a book by the author 's views , then i would highly suggest staying away from this one"

"" i have to admit that i did n't you who you were until i read starless grasslands . i do n't mean to embarrass you ; but that book changed my life . "" i tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment . for the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while i approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile . i very much approved of her legs . as i departed the car , kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes . "" do n't forget . i 'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together . please be ready .

"" well , crabby , are n't you glad to see me ? "" before i could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right . it was jennifer aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit .

"" the two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment . then sandy leapt at jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other . it was a ferocious sight as pulled hair , shrieks of pain , and nylon tearing could be heard . then almost a quickly as it began , the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room . several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor . sandy marched back into the room victorious . i ran to the door of the sitting room only to see jennifer laid out on the floor out cold , spread eagle and naked . before i could think of what to do sandy tapped me on my shoulder . i turned around and there sandy stood . a little worse for wear . trying to catch her breath . nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet . "" forget her . she wo n't bother us now . "" sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face , smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume . she posed standing and anticipating my admiration . "" now i 'm all sweaty and warm . i need a shower .

neg,"david fromkin 's "" peace to end all peace "" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work . many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other . fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east ( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia ) was created during and after the first world war . obviously , in order to do this , the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered . this is where fromkin 's unusual methodology comes into play . focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the "" eastern question "" in their favour , the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process . admittedly , it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn , but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire ( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter ) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much . never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell . a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today , and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations . the problem that fromkin has , however , is that he does not make these very well at all . the story is told in a roughly chronological manner , which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters . ultimately , the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader , who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is . additionally , fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided . indeed , one map ( showing enver pasha 's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia ) is laughable in the extreme . the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows , and not equilateral triagles . where fromkin does well , however , is in his use of purely european sources . it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east , but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question . in terms of europe , however , his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did . ultimately , "" a peace to end all peace "" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work . a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this , and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been ( the chapters in margaret attwood 's "" the peacemakers "" or william cleveland 's "" modern middle east "" both easily outshine this )"

pos,"i purchased this firefly remote a month ago to work with my pc-pvr ( i have got a hauppauge pvr-250 card and beyondtv 3 ) . as my computer and tv set are in different rooms , i thought it would be convenient to have an rf remote control so that i can still control video recording / playback while sitting in front of my tv . rf signals can usually travel a longer distance , and most importantly , they can penetrate walls . however , my first installation with the firefly remote was not a totally success . it functioned well , but i have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power , and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby . i thought either i had a defective item , or the product was not as good as they said . i contacted snapstream for support , and they suggested to try a different usb port or use a powered usb hub for plugging receiver . my computer has 6 usb ports - 4 in back and 2 in front , all built on the motherboard . i was using a front usb for the measurement . after i switched to an usb port in back , everything becomes perfect . i have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard , usb ports can be different , which may provide different power levels for external devices . now my firefly works great for my application , which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall ( and some blocking objects as well ) inbetween . firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse . although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse , it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls . for the convenience the firefly remote brings , i give it 5 stars !"

neg,we purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera . it took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today 's reasonably priced minidv camcorders . however after six months the lcd screen suddenly stopped working . it was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great . we sent it last november to the panasonic authorized service center . they returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available . we were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old . i only share this as a warning to potential buyers . panasonic did not honor our warranty

pos,"the main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the mp3 encoder . with this version , the mp3 encoder is included . magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient . these include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram ( spectral ) editor . also , somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1 / 3 turntable . if you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks . i have two very minor negatives ; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated , the declicker has so few artifacts that i recommend always using it at the maximum setting ( as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations . ) as far as pc requirements , i believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor . this one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact . i do n't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews . in short , i have been totally satisfied with this program 's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1 / 3 rpm records ."
neg,"to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book . one hardly knows where to start . perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel . as such , it is n't even a decent trashy novel ; instead of steamy sex scenes , we get sanctimonious sermonizing . worse than that , what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book , ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late . the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized . even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario ( an idea with virtually no scriptural support ) , little in the characters ' actions , thought processes or dialog rings true . one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student . god ends up looking like the ultimate villain , demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else . whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear ? who is the present-day equivalent of c . s . lewis , or catherine marshall , and why are n't they getting more attention ? these were writers who actually made you think . lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing ; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought . they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask . one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all , or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter . these days , it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson , whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted , bigoted caricature of what it once was . perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured . if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers , then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind"
pos,"this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc. ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists"

pos,"a couple of years ago , we completed the transition over to the mac platform in our household . both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop , so leveraging the .mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic . further , with the sharing features that are available , we each have access to view the other person 's address book or calendar . one of the great features of the .mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system . in addition , since the synch services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open , third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .mac to propagate settings to different machines . my favorite feature ( and the catalyst for my initial subscription ) is the backup application . as someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times , i wanted a simple , comprehensive , easy-to-use solution that i could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis . i 've used other mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the backup you get with .mac . the only real critique i have for the .mac service is the amount of space available on the idisk . when services like google mail can offer 2.7gb of space for free ( granted it is supported by advertising ) , it makes the .mac the space available with .mac seem meager . of course , considering a full backup of my data / settings takes up about 8gb of space , i may be outside of the demographic that the .mac service is targeting . however , in this age of digital media ( pictures and movies ) , the amount of disk space people need for their "" memories "" is only going to go up . but i guess that is why they have external drives and dvd burners"

neg,"i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these.. . ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except "" dog eat dog "" which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an ' 80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the ' 60s and ' 70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , "" dog eat dog "" ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul"

pos,"1990. it dose n't seem like that lond ago . when a barley known mariah carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hase n't been heard since minnie ripperton . she made her appearance when she signed on to columbia records after the now forgotten brenda k . starr , whom mariah was a backup singer for at the time , gave tommy mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history . now about the album . the album starts off with her first single "" vision of love "" a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made mariah a star . you can feel the suspence as mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice . truly to this day , still one of her best songs . "" there 's got to be away "" changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today . this was released as a single in the u.k. ( it was n't released in the u.s. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits ) yet it failed to chart . "" someday "" is the next song and was the albums third single . it too hit number one in 1991. this song is great to hear after a breakup as mariah warns an ex-lover that "" the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for . "" this song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80 's synth beats . "" i do n't want to cry "" was the albums fourth and , in the u.s. , the last release . it too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt . something that will not be accomplished for a long , long time . though mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product , the song still has all the work of a great mariah song and it is the only song that mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with . "" vanishing "" , though never becoming a single , is probably one of the best mariah recordings . a gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven . though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos "" swiftly you 're vanishing , drifting away . "" it has also been called a "" hidden treasure "" by many reviewers . "" all in your mind "" is another song that realy showcase mariah 's vocal capabilities . though this is one of the few songs that sound dated , but definatly worth a listen . "" alone in love "" is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to mariah . truley a mariah great . the next two songs , "" you need me "" and "" sent up from above , "" really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album . they also sound dated and are not the style in which mariah is famous for . still , every mariah song is worth a listen , so go for it ! "" prisoner "" is a truley a great mariah tune . though this has a rock influence as well , she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head . this almost became a single in the u.s. but mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned . "" love takes time "" truly will have a place in my heart . every time i hear this song it takes me back to 1990 , almost like a little time machine . putting this song on her first record almost did n't happen , as mariah har intended it to be on her next record . though tommy mottola and other executives persuaded her to . the style is not that different than "" vision of love , "" where it build untill the brige where mariah lets off her signature high note . this was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990. though music box , daydream , and the emancipation of mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of mariah 's best albums , there is no way you can leave this one out . this album truley is the one that started it all . to this date it has gone 9x platinum and made carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from the voice of this generation . though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to paula abdul , janet jackson , and especially whitney houston , it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90 's and of all time . for some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true . this is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple long island girl named mariah carey , who became a superstar ."

neg,"murky : in his book , 1984 , orwell described a contrived language he called "" newspeak "" , designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible . but before orwell there were russell and whitehead , who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence . as whitehead wrote in his "" foreword "" to quine 's ph.d . dissertation titled a system of logic : logic shapes metaphysical thought . thus in his "" on universals "" quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as "" entities "" . and he co-authored with goodman "" steps toward a constructive nominalism "" , a nominalist manifesto , in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or "" platonists "" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities . i believe that anyone who says that universals are "" referenced "" or who uses the phrase "" abstract entities "" fully deserves to be labeled a platonist . but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak . in the "" search inside this book "" screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting ( p . 20 ) that realists say universals are shared "" entities "" and are "" referents "" of predicates . i ask loux : what happened to signification ? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense ( i.e. signification ) as well as denotation ( i.e. reference ) in the functional ( i.e. predicate ) calculus . i ask loux : what happened to supposition , which distinguishes reference from signification ? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions ( i.e. significations ) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization ( i.e. reference ) , and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects . i ask loux : since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else ? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric ? i see murky writing . muddled : loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine , the pragmatic realist , who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism , and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing . ontological relativity started as an analogy : quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time . einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton 's absolute time , and he rejected lorentz 's making relativistic time apparent time . likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory 's positing of duality and indeterminacy . today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition , nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions . quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs . realism is a natural , primordial , irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories . on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial . it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history . it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories . but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity , and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity "" anti-realism "" . in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism , but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change . i do not find this book contemporary . loux 's "" realism - anti-realism "" locution is a false dichotomy . i see muddled thinking . marginalized : while a student i found notre dame 's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism . when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking . i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students . readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site . thomas j . hicke"

neg,"the versions of "" black sabbath "" and "" war pigs "" actually comprise half of black sabbath 's appearance on the april 26 , 1970 edition of john peel 's ' sunday show . ' "" black sabbath "" features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song . "" war pigs "" is actually "" walpurgis , "" an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics . incidentally , the other two songs from that broadcast , "" fairies wear boots "" and "" behind the wall of sleep , "" were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release . all four of these tracks , while fascinating , do n't rightfully belong on this collection , as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne 's career as a solo artist . for that reason , the live version of "" paranoid "" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary . those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album , particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy 's biggest hits and / or notable tracks such as "" flying high again , "" "" shot in the dark , "" "" i do n't know , "" "" breaking all the rules , "" or "" road to nowhere . "" to add to the confusion , some of the solo-era material included here is n't exactly what it purports to be . ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties . these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with , in some cases , re-recorded tracks . the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts , presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke ( drums ) and bob daisley ( bass ) , who , incidentally , wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from ' blizzard of ozz ' through ' no more tears . ' the ' bark at the moon ' album , while not re-recorded , was most certainly remixed . it is the re-recorded versions of the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' tracks and the remixed version of the ' bark at the moon ' track that appear on the current edition of this collection . finally , the version of "" no more tears "" is actually the video edit , not the album version . in addition , due to one of the disputes mentioned above , ' the ultimate sin ' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy 's catalog . that album 's biggest hit , "" shot in the dark , "" which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection , has now been replaced with "" miracle man "" from ' no rest for the wicked . ' along these lines , the ' just say ozzy ' live ep and the double-disc live album , ' live and loud , ' both of which contain a live version of "" shot in the dark , "" have also been deleted from ozzy 's catalog . not even ' the essential ozzy osbourne , ' a double-disc collection covering ozzy 's entire solo career , features a single song from ' the ultimate sin .

( i could have said 6 minutes , but shaq do n't fool around when it comes to da blues ! ) new , good blues is hard to find , and till "" jumping joe "" bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues , this is one of the best of the last year , along with walter trout 's "" full circle """
pos,"the ergonomics : perfect . the d200 is not completely rubber-encased . there 's rubber where your hands need to hold it , and plastic where your hands rarely touch it . the hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in . the battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic , and hinge-pinned . a simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily ( accidentally ) tripped . the memory card door latch , however , uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 and video out / dc-in doors are made of flexible rubber , and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves . the english language operating manual is a work of art . each operating concept is alpha ' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram , and to the page where the function is explained in perfect english . the reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized . i like the depth of field preview , the mirror lock-up , and the multiple-exposure capability . the continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object . if you have the old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses from the ' 70 's and ' 80 's , except for a few rare exceptions , will fit on the d200. all these positive attributes remind me of the best , most highly-evolved film camera slr's . no wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media ."

neg,"he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness , perseverance and dreams of ordinary people . in "" sandra "" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour . the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique . in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions . he released a few inspired tracks now and then , his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth , and "" here at the mayflower "" was a sincere effort . he is an intelligent person who cares for music and does n't let his superstardom go to his head . so , what has changed ? and why this late in his career ? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer , liberace style . and he 's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens . i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy , like liberace did . and i have deep respect for that . but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that does n't really have any demands ."

pos,"well presented , easy to follow along , and easy to revisit previous lessons . videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played . not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students . some of the accompanyment / singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along . some of the material / songs may not be to everyones liking , but again , these are okay for the beginner . the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes . i probably would n't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and i do n't think most people buying it would think it 's all the will every need to become a great guitar player . i 'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique . i 'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar ."
neg,"the whole point of this ghost story , is like in the orinigal , a surprise , twisted ending . yet , once again , in a 90 's hollywood horror flick , it is dissappointing . the actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect , but , there not to blame . the blame is the poor script writing for this movie . the movie has you going until about half way through , when they introduce the ghost to you . now , unlike any other ghost in hollywood history , this ghost is literally a black blob . it contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face , which in turn , reveals the face of whom it kills . but , literally , when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie , you better make sure its in the right one . this movie should probably been called the blob , not house on haunted hill . it is a horrible re-make and a waste of about 2 hours . please , for your own sake , rent some good genre horror , like halloween or when a stranger calls . not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in . better luck next time to the director , producer , co - producer , and writer of this film , because of all the people that took part , probably just wanted to make some cheap money , so they made a movie . better luck next time"

neg,""" st. elmo 's fire "" is one of those movies that could have been better , should have been better and yet , it just wasn't . it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s , the so-called brat pack ( well , everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall , who were spared this misstep ) . maybe this was supposed to be "" the breakfast club - - after college "" , but while "" the breakfast club "" had characters , even stereotypical characters , that you could relate to , there is absolutely no one , with the exception of emilio estevez ' character , that you care enough about to relate to in this film . the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois , but georgetown , where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college . uh-huh . yeah , right . judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is , nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy , in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that . andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy ( or maybe it 's just the pearls ? ) emilio estevez is a future attorney , working as a waiter / server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell . mare winningham is a dowdy , trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity , working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her . she instead fantasizes about rob lowe , who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band , who has dropped out of school , married a white trash-y looking groupie , had a child with her and has now separated from her , and taking up with other groupies . demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking , has a serious coke problem , stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol . sounds promising , huh ? well , in what is an early portend of the "" melrose place "" to come , sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is , dumps his ass , immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy , who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job ; estevez , after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there , travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her . he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed , he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home . lowe , in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere , takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus . moore , after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother , has all her furnishings repossessed , loses her job and freaks out . not exactly "" the breakfast club "" . the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves . with the exception of estevez ' character , they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped . their every action , every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional . their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that . winningham 's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy , knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was . and yet , she still gave her virginity to him . maybe if winningham was n't so bright , or she was a college freshman , it would be understandable . but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent . lowe really had little to do with his role . maybe if he had played the role nelson had - - as the roving lothario , with sheedy waiting at home , it might have gone over better . with his too-pretty looks , it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him . nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off - -but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player . moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems , mirroring her character - - but was later rehired . while the title song later become a minor hit , "" st. elmo 's fire "" itself missed the mark ."

pos,"hayley westenra , at only 18 years old , is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come . this is an uplifting and at times , spiritual album that shows shades of greatness . throughout , westenra 's voice is captivating , though the musical scores are at times , sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent . there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated "" the female josh grobin "" , but i think a more accurate sentiment would be "" a young sarah brightman "" . odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes , all of which match up well with westenra 's abilities . bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet , dell amore non si sa . they pair up for that one song , but the rest is all westenra . this is smooth , soothing and easy listening . if you like brightman , you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra ."

neg,"hate to say it , but this is pretty drab stuff . that said , i 'm hardly about to complain ; how could i ? this was obviously written for a film ( that i have no interest in seeing ) , and mogwai just released ' mr. beast ' , a solid ( if unspectacular ) album earlier this year . i kind of see ' zidane ' as a gift , then . looking at the whole thing from that perspective , it 's impossible to be letdown . but then , retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult . mogwai , when channeling the right energies , create sublime , beautiful music - - truly as beautiful as any form of modern music , to my ears . when they 're a bit more ambiguous , though , the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction . ' zindane ' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent , but the result is surprisingly dull - - at best , it 's pretty ; at worst , it 's utterly monotonous . the ideas are here , too ; it 's not that ' zindane ' lacks drive or intent . it is a focused work . yet , it 's obvious , i think , that the music , contrary to most film scores , desires to refrain from emotional manipulation . while that 's admirable , i find that musically , i 'd much rather be manipulated than dazed ; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers . there are a few nice themes and motifs , do n't get me wrong , but this is all underscore - - mogwai , in the best way possible , has a great gift at handling melodrama , and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light . i wo n't sway anyone from attempting to get ' zidane ' , but i would n't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration . no , for that , i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums . for , mogwai is a band , after all - - they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone . for those unaware , mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film ' the fountain ' - - though they did not write any of the actual material , from what i 've gathered - - and as a musical experience , the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows ' zidane ' out of the water . in my opinion , it even beats out ' mr. beast ' , so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai ' oughta check that one out for sure"

pos,"i received one of these for christmas...so i 've had it for 6 months now . i 've taken thousands of shots with it , on both a canon digital rebel xt ( 350d ) and a canon eos 20d . the bottom line...i really like the lens . although you must learn to to optimize its use at 200mm . specifics.. . 1 ) at 200mm ( max telephoto ) , you will see some blur if you do n't use a high shutter speed and hold it steady . this means that just placing your camera on the green "" point and shoot "" mode , or even "" p "" mode may not give you a fast enough shutter speed to keep from having blur unless you are in bright daylight . so....here 's my technique : at 200mm you may want to bump up your iso ( film ) speed to 400 or 800 , then use tv mode ( canon settings i 'm talking about - manual shutter speed control ) to get a fast shutter speed . i also hold the end of the lens ( the petal filter ) with my left hand and lean against a solid object or have a good foot stance - or use a tripod . all of this is not any sort of lens defect ; rather , it is typical of using a long tele lens that does not have image stabilization ( is ) . you can get is from canon , but be ready to lay down some $$$ and carry multiple lenses...more on that later . 2 ) noisy autofocus . yeah , true , it is louder than other lenses , but so what . it is not any louder than the fake autowinder sound my rebel xt makes . i find its focus quick and accurate - except in low light . although , i will say my 20d does much better than my 350d did with this lens in low light . but , honestly , i do n't think the low light autofocus is any worse than the canon 18-55 kit lens i initially ised . it hunted a lot too in low light , and often would not lock - necessitating manual focus . perhaps it is the camera , not the lens . regardless , manual focus on the sigma works great in low light , or , to keep autofocus , you can use an external flash for ir focus assist and it locks right up . other than the tamron , you will not find as versatile a lens as this one , especially at this price point . optical quality is great on my lens . you can do better - but with two lenses . my solution to have this kind of range if $$$ was no object would be the canon ef-s 17-85mm f4-5.6 is usm and the canon ef 70-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 do is usm...this would add image stabilization and 100mms more range , but at much more cost , and you would have to carry two lenses . i specifically bought this lens to have a compact , one lens solution . if you read all the reviews you can find , the general consensus is that the sigma is better than the tamron 18-200. plus , the end barrel does not rotate , so you can use a circular polarizer . show me a lens that has better bang for the buck in a one lens solution , and i 'll buy it . until then , i love my sigma"
neg,"after watching spirited away i was excited to watch other movies by the same director . unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic "" it 's bad to hate "" message . what the creators of princess mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive , disgusting things of the world . yes , hate can become overly consuming , just as any other emotion can overcome us , or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one 's , ( just as loving that which is evil would n't be a good thing ) but placed in its proper context at the proper time , at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems . and the people who claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the "" haters "" , which i find comical . the movie also has strong pro feminist / anti man messages . i wanted to like this film but i do n't appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense"

neg,i am far from an expert however even for an amatuer this lens was horrible . i took about 400 shots with my digital rebel xt and got so frustrated witht the poor quality of the auto focus that i immediately returned it / got a refund . in all but the brightest lighting conditions this lens was extremely slow with the autofocus . in many cases the lens could not focus and continually hunted through it 's entire range . since most of my photography is of animals i simply could not wait for the autofocus to work and missed many shots . i tested the autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s ( packaged with the rebel xt ) and a canon 75-300 ef . in every instance where the tamron could not focus the canon lenses had no problem ! when the tamron would focus i found the pictures were not as sharp as my canon lenses . again i 'm far from an expert however i was only printing 4x6 photos . i replaced the tamron with a quantaray ( sigma ) 55-200 dc which has proven to have a very good autofocus and great optical quality ( for amatuers. . ) bottom line. . it was hard to part with the tamron because i was really enthused about the zoom range however i would much prefer to use 2 lenses can focus than 1 that doesn't . i have read many reviews with the same problem noted . tamron needs to get thier act together

neg,to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about 5 mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
pos,"given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt frontpage was a a really big help . i was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering . i did n't realize though that frontpage is n't the cureall for making a website really . primarily only for web design i.e. if you want to make a website with e-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like , you 're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in asp or php . but as far as web design goes frontpage can take a novice a long way ."
pos,"with 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids , i have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer . almost all of them like all types of games , but the i spy series is one of the most played series that i have . the i spy treasure hunt notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults , and yet can actually be played by young kids as well . the i spy series has always had very hight quality games , and this is at the top of the list for me . i will warn you though , that if you play with your kids , be prepaired to surprised . my usual play is for me to help the kids search , and not find items and tell them , but if they get stuck , point out an area to look at . with this one , i have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before i could find even one of them . great play for everyone . super recommended"

neg,"while "" talk to the hand "" is inescapably mediocre in comparison to "" eats , shoots & leaves "" , a book i found amusing , though not up-to-par to its new york times bestseller status , this book does have its moments . however , i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that , despite whatever way she meant it , ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice . i find it interesting that she , or at least her editors , did not further investigate the disease ( which , indeed , gluten tolerance is ) before publishing such a degrading remark . oh , yes , bloody well sorry , ms. truss , for invading your rude , stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which , i 'm sure , someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet . let 's just go and , well , obliterate a genetic disorder ! while we 're at it , we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk . if it pleases and thanks you , ms. truss , we celiacs will eat cake . ( oh , bloody hell , did i just say "" please "" ? ) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place , i have to wonder if she 's experiencing the effects of projection . in explaining how rude we humans are , it was necessary for her to be quite rude , as well . it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer : i also found her supermarket incident , in which a kid shouts at his mother , "" i want that one , you effing bitch ! "" , among others , a bit offensive . as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness , i was often thoroughly appalled by this book . no , my friends and i do n't usually hold doors for each other , but , in general , i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown . frankly , i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends , as well as strangers , than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others . i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation , or , if they must answer , they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them . i have to argue that we are not a select group . in today 's world , one sees what one expects to see ; one is treated as one expects to be treated . ms. truss , i believe , would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could , she would be surprised to find that , when people are rude , she cares less because she knows that she , at least , is doing her best not to be . if she did this , maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior . my last complaint is this : "" gluten crap "" ? you would think that such a sophisticated , eloquent ( as she is dedicated to proving ) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year , am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin ' ( ? ) style word "" crap ."

pos,"i used this program on a 5-state road trip of the midwest , and while overall it was "" adequate , "" it had some key shortcomings . the bad stuff : first , this is not an especially user-friendly program ; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability . spend a lot of time playing with this before using it as a primary navigator ! a lot of the commands are not intuitive , and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out . this can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere . it does n't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen . for example , to get the program to talk to you , you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen . if you are on any other of the many tabs , the program does n't talk to you or show you the turns . it took me hours to figure this out ! the help function was useless . second , the tracking can be very slow , and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns- -especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country- -which happened to me numerous times . many times the screen showed me i had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn , and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign . third , the "" rerouting "" function is awful and perhaps the biggest problem with this program : if you stray from the route- -even to pull off and get gas- -the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct . i have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route . i also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route ( see below ) . several times in several different cities , the re-routing function was totally wrong- -spitting out names of streets that were n't even on the screen at close zoom level . this is a really annoying glitch , and it happened without fail every time i strayed from the route . once off route , there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you 're off route , and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a change in the route . when there is construction that you did n't anticipate , for example , this program sucks at being able to change the route once you 've started on it . very annoying . there is no construction updater plug-in , which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever . fourth , the program does not audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street . this actually happened to me , as there were no "" one way "" signs on a particular street in springfield , il . though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way , but the voice commands did n't warn me that i actually was going the wrong way , so had i not been looking at the screen , i would n't have known . you ca n't always look at the screen when driving . and in iowa on i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes . i was heading north in the southbound lanes ( as i was supposed to ) but there was no visual or audible indication that i was going the wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use . i needed to find a police station while in missouri- -no such luck . i also needed to find the state fairgrounds in missouri ( which i later came across on the screen ) but it did not show up when i intentionally searched for it . search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program . sixth , several times the screen showed me "" off route "" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when i was in fact on a u.s. highway or interstate . something was n't communicating correctly . other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though i was certainly on the highway . in illinois , the screen showed i was pretty much driving through corn fields even though i was on a u.s. route . this problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways . if you 're not in the center lane , often the program indicates you 're off route . very annoying . seventh , the zoom level does not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators , but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes . eighth , the help function is a joke . it is totally lacking in substantive information . the program should come with a separate dvd movie showing how to use it . ninth , the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms . for example , some u.s. routes also have county / state / local designation numbers and / or an alphabetic name , but the map often only listed one or two of the many "" also known as "" names / numbers . this can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads do n't match up with the turn commands ( e.g. "" turn left on u.s. route 40 , "" when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers . this was also quite annoying . tenth , the antenna that comes with the program sucks . without fail , i would get a red "" no signal "" indicator in every city i was in where there were high-rise buildings . this happened in kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , and springfield . if you are in a city , you risk having no gps tracking ability . and yes , my antenna was mounted as recommended . at one point i held it up through my open sun roof with no success . eleventh , the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger 's seat . you pretty much have to pull over or risk crashing to see what you 're clicking on . yes , i 'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving . i 'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator / operator . twelfth , trip planning is lacking . when you input a starting and ending point , the program gives you one route . there is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them . true , you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads , but this function is not easy to use . several times the program kept me off the interstates when i wanted to be on them , and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when i wanted to be on u.s. or smaller county roads ( for sightseeing purposes ) . i would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route . thirteenth , i emailed a list of my concerns / constructive criticisms / recommendations to the folks at delorme . never heard back from them , which does concern me as a quality issue . ok , so there were some redeeming qualities : first , *in general* the gps tracker was on-target . for about 95% of my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i was and the program operated just fine . just realize that this program ( as well as gps in general ) has a lot of limitations , especially when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions . third , you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself . i used this function a lot to mark places where i want to return to take photos in daylight . fourth , there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors ( black background with bright road colors ) . this is quite helpful . in summation , for the money this program is a good deal , but do not rely on it ( or any gps program ) as your *sole* source of road information / navigation . if i had n't had my rand mcnally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps i borrowed from the library , i would have been in big trouble several times . there are a lot of ways this program can and should be improved , but in the meantime i 'd still recommend it despite the problems . knowing the limitations that i 've listen can save you time and frustration . there is no better alternative imho for the price . it 's possible that some of my complaints do have fixes , but you would n't know it from the crappy help function ."

pos,"i hesitated for so long to get this . having followed moby 's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years . i like his early techno / rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns . but i wondered : has moby gone soft ? has he sold out ? i was pleasantly surprised . look at the cover and add rain . that 's the overall mood of this album . i find rain to be cleansing on many levels , often building a mood of pensiveness , reflection and a fragile peacefulness . there is a glorious melancholy in the music , the lyrics and the singing on the album . take the chilled out moments from moby 's other albums and build on it . that 's what he 's done here . almost every song has singing - primarily moby 's longing , almost cyring , voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights , when the world does n't make sense , when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart , yet with a subtle hope underneath it all . it 's downtempo , mellow , moody and sometimes sad . but it is beautiful . do n't expect "" old "" moby , do n't look for the commercial jingles of play . just put it on and listen"
pos,"one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck 's incredible talent . i 'd match her up against any actress of her era or any other era ! ! here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi-dimensions of her characters . sugarpuss o'shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive , good-looking gentleman . but she also shows her love to the other professors . 1941 was stanwyck 's greatest movie year.....she made "" meet john doe "" and "" the lady eve "" in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them . stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything ! ! from drama to comedy , to musicals and of course westerns ! ! while stanwyck 's singing is not on a par with her other talents ( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire ) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film ( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer ) . bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting . she could n't sing or dance ( as barbara did in ball of fire , lady of burlesque , this is my affair and banjo on my knee ) . katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms , high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical . she could n't sing ) . joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she could n't sing . doris day was brilliant in comedy , musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy . the same with judy garland . rare is the talent who could do it all . i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all....drama , comedy , westerns , musicals ! ! heroine or villainess ! stanwyck 's work is always first class even when applied to material that is not . she was simply the greatest and i 'm sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses ! ! the movie , ball of fire is great fun ! ! from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable ! ! ! and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well ! ! there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch !"
neg,"i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally ."

pos,"first of all , let me say this product is great in almost every way . so if you need to feel better about your nose and / or throat , go for it . my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided to produce his own machine and , if i 'm right , viajet is making it for him . viajet sells the same machine , except for the grossan tip , at about -again - a half the price of the hydro pulse . the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) . so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business , after all . other than that , like i have said , this product is great for almost any respiratory problem . i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle , and is intended to use it over 50 times . the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime , so you get the idea . also , if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment , look for the buteyko method"

pos,"i have to say i was getting worried that john adams was becoming a has-been . el nino 's first half was much better than the second , i did n't particularly like transmigration and i defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work american berserk and tell me it 's any good . but after this release , i stand humbly corrected - - he 's still , in my opinion , america 's , if not the world 's , best living composer . dharma at big sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that 's not well-tempered . what really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style i 've never heard before in classical music . the first movement "" a new day "" with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it 's the creation of an entire universe . the climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of adams 's works to date . dharma is an absolute masterpiece . my father knew charles ives is wonderful too , even if it 's not as powerful or moving as dharma . the work is both an homage to ives and a reflection of adams ' life . clearly , adams had a great childhood . the first movement , concord , is playful - - the clearest tribute to ives , since it 's sounds structurarlly similar to his fourth of july . the chaos in adams ' concord is a little more rigid than ives ' , but it 's still fun . the second movement , "" the lake "" , features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer 's father . the scurrying of the last movement , "" the mountain "" , seems needlessly frenetic at times , but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it . my one bone to pick is with nonesuch . the two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music - - an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single cd , especially when other works like guide to strange places go unrecorded . so why put these two works on 2 cds ? is it to justify the $20 sticker price ? an artistic statement to completely separate the two works ? it just seems silly . but it 's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute cds that really should stop . people want to hear the astonishing sound world that adams creates - - why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time ? buy this disc , even if it 's split into 2 pieces . it 's the best of his works yet"
neg,"the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100% ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too"

pos,"it embarrases me that i , a music man , have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie . my wife rented it from a hasting 's video store back when dvds were not widely distributed . i was in awe of the movie as it ended because i had no clue what to expect , and i was n't expecting much anyway . richard dreyfuss plays the role of glenn holland , a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income ( he calls it a ' fall back position ' ) while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous . his first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded . but he finds his way into the students ' hearts . the movie begins in the early 1960s , and rock ' n ' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape . most of the students , of course , love the new music . realizing he has an ' in ' with the students , he makes an accurate comparison by playing bach 's "" minuet in g "" ( for anna magdalena ) and asking the students what song it is . they reply it is the "" lovers concerto "" by the toys ( "" what color is the rain that falls softly on my window. . "" ) . he notes they are wrong and that it is actually the same song ( although he does n't note that bach 's is in 3 / 4 and the toys in 4 / 4 ) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the dorian scale . he now has them right where he wants them . along the way , he continues to work on his masterpiece . but life , a new baby who turns out to be deaf , and the need for new things put his life on hold . as he notes by quoting john lennon , "" life is what happens while you 're making other plans "" ( or some facsimile thereof ) . years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher . he has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football . he has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous . yet he always comes back to the simple rock ' n ' roll to make his point about ' real ' music . but reality plays hide and seek sometimes . he has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night john lennon is killed . over time , they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he ' hears ' the music . but another reality awaits - education budget cuts , and here dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect : "" the day they cut the football budget in this state...well , that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it . "" it is in the presence of his now good friend , jay thomas ( the football coach ) , that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do . the music track in this movie is awesome . there 's just one thing i 'm still trying to figure out : how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it ?"

pos,"i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly . i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each . what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes . it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature . the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze . when working with paper , this was not always an easy task to take on . several weeks ago , i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007. the improvements are rather subtle , but powerful . it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features . after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun . here are some of the beneficial features : -like a paper notebook you have sections , but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like . -you can easily link pages to outlook . i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings . it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze . -also , it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish . you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails . well worth your time . -it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do . i love it for that use . there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well . if you use a tablet , this is a great feature . -as was with the earlier version , you can add voice content to your notes . that 's right , voice recorded messages can be added to your notes . too cool . before you buy , you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version . you 'll be able to assess for yourself . i think you 'll be pleased . i fond it to be one of the best products for ' electronic file keeping ' that i 've used . for the price , it 's not a bad deal ."

( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera"
pos,"the new nikon en-el3e battery is a slight update for the nikon en-el3 provided with earlier dslr models such as the d70. it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery . the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en-el3. the en-el3e is backwards compatible with the en-el3 : you can put it in your d70 or d50. the reverse is not true . the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , and of course , camera . ( the 2.5 "" lcd on the d200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller d70. ) it is sufficient for a day of shooting . unless you are using a d200 in some professional capacity , in which case , you 'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery"
pos,this was one of the first hiphop albums i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that krs 's style was best suited to primos production . once he lost primo ( with the exception of a few albums ) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly . krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack mcs that deserved it . this was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp days as well as few musical / lyrical tricks up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into hiphop this was the era that i belive hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper .

( a taxi "" disengorging "" its passengers is categorically bad writing . ) and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe 's the day of the jackal . i would n't read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business ( rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records ) . stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline , but then rowe was going by just a demo tape . better writing books are out there"

neg,"the easy language 16 is only useful if you 're already familiar with the language you wish to learn . i 've been studying french for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when i 'm getting rusty . the only problem is that it 's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear . the recorded speakers also do n't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said . this is good cause it 's like listening to an actual french speaker and not a robot , bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said . it will also go over basic french grammar but is totally useless if you do n't already know basic french grammar . i also tried to use this to learn japanese . unlike french , i 'm not familiar with the japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare . if all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out . unfortunately the basic japanese grammar and japanese alphabet are all written in japanese . for instance , in the grammar section it has the past , present and future "" i am "" it 's written in english then beside it it 's written in japanese . you ca n't click them to have it sound out for you . in the japanese alphabet section all it has is the japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out . so it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in japanese . i do want to learn how to read , write and speak japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read , write , and speak japanese ! so my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with japanese ( not the romanized ( romanjj ) version ) already in order to use this product . because of my experiences with this product i would say get it only if you know the languages you 're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more . since i am familiar with french this product was pretty helpful but if i used this as a starter for the language i probably would have quit . i 'm searching amazon for better japanese books . so if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and cd 's"

pos,the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
neg,"conclusions : to start from the end i got the xacti ca6 , tested it and returned it . here are the pros and cons . pros - 1. very small , just put in your pocket and go 2. easy and simple controls 3. super fast start up from sleep mode 4. good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode ( i had no issue with the video pausing , no way around that ) 6. you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7. sd card that records for a long time 8. easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1. indoor video unacceptable , although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes , it is extremely grainy ( more so than my sony digicam videos ! ! ) 2. super slow zoom when in video mode 3. in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry ( especially when trying to capture a kid on the move , for scenery it might be ok ) 4. in low lighting stills are unusable ( even at short distance ) due to a very , very weak flash . 5. red eye almost every time the flash works 6. strap is a joke 7. no lens cover so in short , on paper this camera is great , i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd , the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless . but....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting ( see above ) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions ( for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical ) . this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand ( for taking stills ) . for almost everyone else it is not adequate , i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder ( going for the elura 100 ) ..... ya , i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand , i was hoping to prove them wrong... . ; - ("
pos,"i 'm pleased with the purchase . i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad . i spent six months in england , with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt . it 's very sturdy if nothing else , between the trains , planes , hostels , and general bustle i 'm very pleased with how well it held up . nothing on it broke . i probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip , if not more . sure i 've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i 've had it , but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well . the zoom on this camera is very nice . it 's one of the better zooms i 've seen on a simple camera of this type , or at least it was back when i bought it . it also has several features that older film cameras do not , such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture , or settings to take "" portraits "" or "" night shots .

neg,"mcmurtrys new album really disappoints . i am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with james past work ( as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical ) . while mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza ( see the elephant ) or that provide an echo to the way we americans spend our time ( holiday ) , his attempts on childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing . in past attempts mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of americana , yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside . the thoughtfulness evaporated on this work . like many aging musicians , mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse . the cliche and empty "" we cant make it here "" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility . mcmurtry , previously able to frame an issue , seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills . criticism is not intelligence , and we can only hope that mcmurtry can get on track going forward . perhaps he should shun the "" pc crowd "" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial american scene for his next album"
neg,"this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths , and underlying the story are indeed echoes , sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted , of ancient myths . god is allegorized as gabalawi , the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs . the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters . the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad . then there is a fifth story , in which the central figure , a ` magician ' , is presumably a scientist . he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it , but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' . it makes no difference : the scientist , who has invented a weapon of great destructive power , is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer , and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever , though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering . subtle the book is not , either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive . the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names , but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another . a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent . they mostly ` shout ' , ` scream ' , ` shriek ' , ` yell ' , ` cry ' or ` sneer ' , which becomes rather tiresome . the literary quality of this novel is , i think , greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature . but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life ."

pos,"i used this program on a 5-state road trip of the midwest , and while overall it was "" adequate , "" it had some key shortcomings . the bad stuff : first , this is not an especially user-friendly program ; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability . spend a lot of time playing with this before using it as a primary navigator ! a lot of the commands are not intuitive , and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out . this can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere . it does n't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen . for example , to get the program to talk to you , you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen . if you are on any other of the many tabs , the program does n't talk to you or show you the turns . it took me hours to figure this out ! the help function was useless . second , the tracking can be very slow , and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns- -especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country- -which happened to me numerous times . many times the screen showed me i had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn , and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign . third , the "" rerouting "" function is awful and perhaps the biggest problem with this program : if you stray from the route- -even to pull off and get gas- -the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct . i have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route . i also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route ( see below ) . several times in several different cities , the re-routing function was totally wrong- -spitting out names of streets that were n't even on the screen at close zoom level . this is a really annoying glitch , and it happened without fail every time i strayed from the route . once off route , there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you 're off route , and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a change in the route . when there is construction that you did n't anticipate , for example , this program sucks at being able to change the route once you 've started on it . very annoying . there is no construction updater plug-in , which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever . fourth , the program does not audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street . this actually happened to me , as there were no "" one way "" signs on a particular street in springfield , il . though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way , but the voice commands did n't warn me that i actually was going the wrong way , so had i not been looking at the screen , i would n't have known . you ca n't always look at the screen when driving . and in iowa on i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes . i was heading north in the southbound lanes ( as i was supposed to ) but there was no visual or audible indication that i was going the wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use . i needed to find a police station while in missouri- -no such luck . i also needed to find the state fairgrounds in missouri ( which i later came across on the screen ) but it did not show up when i intentionally searched for it . search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program . sixth , several times the screen showed me "" off route "" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when i was in fact on a u.s. highway or interstate . something was n't communicating correctly . other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though i was certainly on the highway . in illinois , the screen showed i was pretty much driving through corn fields even though i was on a u.s. route . this problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways . if you 're not in the center lane , often the program indicates you 're off route . very annoying . seventh , the zoom level does not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators , but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes . eighth , the help function is a joke . it is totally lacking in substantive information . the program should come with a separate dvd movie showing how to use it . ninth , the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms . for example , some u.s. routes also have county / state / local designation numbers and / or an alphabetic name , but the map often only listed one or two of the many "" also known as "" names / numbers . this can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads do n't match up with the turn commands ( e.g. "" turn left on u.s. route 40 , "" when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers . this was also quite annoying . tenth , the antenna that comes with the program sucks . without fail , i would get a red "" no signal "" indicator in every city i was in where there were high-rise buildings . this happened in kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , and springfield . if you are in a city , you risk having no gps tracking ability . and yes , my antenna was mounted as recommended . at one point i held it up through my open sun roof with no success . eleventh , the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger 's seat . you pretty much have to pull over or risk crashing to see what you 're clicking on . yes , i 'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving . i 'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator / operator . twelfth , trip planning is lacking . when you input a starting and ending point , the program gives you one route . there is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them . true , you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads , but this function is not easy to use . several times the program kept me off the interstates when i wanted to be on them , and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when i wanted to be on u.s. or smaller county roads ( for sightseeing purposes ) . i would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route . thirteenth , i emailed a list of my concerns / constructive criticisms / recommendations to the folks at delorme . never heard back from them , which does concern me as a quality issue . ok , so there were some redeeming qualities : first , *in general* the gps tracker was on-target . for about 95% of my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i was and the program operated just fine . just realize that this program ( as well as gps in general ) has a lot of limitations , especially when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions . third , you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself . i used this function a lot to mark places where i want to return to take photos in daylight . fourth , there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors ( black background with bright road colors ) . this is quite helpful . in summation , for the money this program is a good deal , but do not rely on it ( or any gps program ) as your *sole* source of road information / navigation . if i had n't had my rand mcnally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps i borrowed from the library , i would have been in big trouble several times . there are a lot of ways this program can and should be improved , but in the meantime i 'd still recommend it despite the problems . knowing the limitations that i 've listen can save you time and frustration . there is no better alternative imho for the price . it 's possible that some of my complaints do have fixes , but you would n't know it from the crappy help function ."

neg,"if there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was "" history of violence "" on critics top ten list , everyone was talking about the performances of viggo and maria and ed , so i went into it with high expectations . honestly it was n't horrible , but it was n't worth all the worship that the hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either . the story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers , only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of ed harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall . ed ( mr. fogarty ) is in the mob and seems to think that viggo ( tom ) is joey cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge . tom , and his wife edie ( played by maria bello ) have two children , a farmhouse , and a diner and tom insist that he is n't joey . the story goes on , dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex . maria bello has never been one of my favorite actresses , i think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair ( evidence is in the movie ) she brings the level of believability down and makes viggo 's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent . we soon figure out that tom is indeed joey and after we say goodbye to ed harris 's character ( of which i was just disappointed to see , c'mon he was awesome ! ) tom / joey goes to see his brother , richie ( william hurt ) to make amends for disappearing , and soon realizes that richie wants him dead . so more killing , more blood , and tom / joey is finally free of his past , if his family would take him back . of course they do , really , his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table ( his daughter sets a place for him.. . ) and the movie is over . there was no aha moment , the action was n't anything new , the story was predictable and the setting was "" been there done that "" . viggo is an amazing actor , and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the tom / joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into , the shift of reality was barely noticeable . maria bello , needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough , sexy , stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly , it does n't work for her , she cannot pull it off . so i do n't recommend this movie , its slow , its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be"

neg,"office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word- -anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988. another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997. apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them- -such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier"

pos,"this dvd teaches the history of tai chi , and the history of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form . it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style , and that now they are usually done for health improvement . then it shows the 24 posture form from the front , and the back , and with breathing instructions . im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements , but when i am , this is a great guide . it then shows each of the 24 postures , and their original martial art applications , which helps you have a strong intent during the posture , and keeps your arms and legs in proper position . then , it teaches the 24 posture form , step by step , with very detailed instruction . this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs . the dvd also shows the 48 posture form , which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form , and has other movements from other styles . it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average . it has also improved my confidence , and people keep saying i have a glow about me . i just feel healthier , and happier too . this dvd is easy to learn from quickly . the chinese bamboo flute music is nice . oh , actually , my favorite part is at the end , it shows a ' slideshow ' of photos of the master , doing each posture move-by-move , with great music . i like to do my form along to this section , because it is a bit slower than the actual form , and you can exactly match your movements to the master . its like having a one-on-one class with him . i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly . i remember the form now , without having to ' think ' , so i can try to turn my attention inward . a great dvd"
pos,"with every grisham book i read , i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense , but to insert other elements to make this human as well . for once , we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain . however , this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune . however , she does not know this . a lawyer is sent to find her , and in the process , undergoes a fundamental change of his own . this story takes place in washington , maryland , west virginia , and the rain forests along the brazilian-bolivian border . in typical grisham fashion , he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book , enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes . you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions . you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight . you can envision the rainforest , and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley . this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue . the pages literally turn themselves . do not start this novel before going to bed , or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down ."

pos,"this is a difficult album to review . people either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced , overblown waste of their time . however , i can say that this is my favorite oasis album . why ? that 's a very good question...maybe because be here now was my introduction to oasis , and i could tell that this band had a lot to offer , even through the drug-addled , overproduced songs that seemed to last forever . each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it , two characteristics of most oasis songs . it 's no use comparing be here now to morning glory or def . maybe , because it 's in a whole other ballpark . this is oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit . no doubt that all the coke helped with that . it 's my firm belief that morning glory and def . maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights . be here now is just something else , you either love it or hate it . it has it 's own little oasis category . i can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors . there are some valid complaints about this album , though . one , it is very very overproduced , filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else . unfortunately , this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long . two , the songs are astonishingly long at times . all around the world , while an excellent song , clocks in at around 9:20. i believe that the shortest song is i hope , i think , i know , coming in at 4:23. so you know you 're in for a long , wild ride . however , only oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable . all the arrogance , coke , and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people . and of course , there 's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : "" the beatles are quite good , but oasis is much better . "" and so a resounding yes to all of these : overproduced , arrogant , drug-induced , staggering , amazing , excellent . i do n't care about the negative things , though , because that 's what makes be here now a sucess in its own right ."

neg,"this is the first review i have written in probably a few years . normally , i do n't feel strongly enough about any product , good or bad , to bother entering a review . with this new version of quicken , i have something that i feel strongly enough to write about . i have been using quicken for close to 20 years . i have built all of my finances around it . for the past 6 years , quicken has been going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i do n't see how the product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product is . no functionality has been added in the previous 6 years . what has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to quicken 's "" financial partners "" , and more redundant links to other , old , program features , and more white space . in return , the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous . entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds . that means , once you hit the "" enter "" key to complete a transaction , you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction . as little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second . obviously , time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that quicken now requires you to "" downgrade "" your quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version . all of this with no additional features or functionality . there is a new kid on the block that i am switching to . it is called "" moneydance "" . it can import data from quicken , it is fast , compact , and runs on any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os / 2. it is easier to use than quicken and the support is great . it is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30. you can actually speak to a person to get help w / out having to pay . since i have been using quicken for years , it will take a while to test mondeydance out to make sure it works properly . i am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree . so far , things are going well . then i plan to dump quicken forever . the well has run dry at quicken ; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company . obviously the people at quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want . but they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade . yet , that is what they are doing . i am absolutely positively through with quicken , and i am not coming back"

pos,"i recently finished reading this book . this is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour . it would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book . some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself . while i am not qualified to comment on these reviews , one thing i can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it . a theory , that too developed quarter century ago , can not be expected to stand 100% vindicated today . the more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to . so may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things . after reading this book i could find out why i behave the way i behave mostof the times . to a certain extent i learnt to control my responses . also i have a feeling that the claims made by dr. harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge , then prevalent . second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people . i think this conclusion is far from correct . dr. harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to "" i am not ok and you are ok "" category . out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual . the objective here is not to merely categorize , but to show that how most of us have the common position "" i am not ok and you are ok "" . now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature , but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses . third critisism on this book stems from the fact dr. harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100%. it seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon . i do n't think dr. harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100%. the books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals ( with whom he does not agree 100% ) for the benefit of the reader . to call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself . i feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers . read this book with an open mind . read the chapeters on pac and marriage , pac and children , pac and social implications , pac and moral values . in this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day , it tries to teach something good ( and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute ) . thanks"

neg,"the problem with america was that started out great . the first album was fresh and different from everything . three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own . "" horse with no name "" and "" sandman "" , was what pave the way for them . the problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop . they should of left "" muskrat love . "" to the captain and tennille . this album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end . the problem was that there was their first two albums , ( america and venture highway ) and there was their others . my recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans"

neg,"i bought my kodak v570 less than a year ago . at first the only annoyance i had was the fact that i had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in mov format that made it diffcult to edit . but a few months ago , the focus refused to work properly . in wide angle , it was fine but when i zoomed in , the image was unacceptably blur . i tried every setting , finally gave up and called kodak service . i was asked to mail the camera to sydney from melbourne where i live . a few weeks later , the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it . since i still could not take acceptable pictures , i contacted them again . this time to be told to send pictures via e-mail . i did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images . but the pictures were taken in broad daylight . when i disagreed with the logic of the comment , i was told to call them for a discussion over the phone . but the number they gave me was a fax number . using my resources , i got in touch with technical service by phone . this time i was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright , it 's probably due to shaky hands ! it 's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives . it is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent india trip when many of the pictures turned out blur . now i have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people . there is no way i will ever buy another kodak again . i can recommend it only to my worst enemies . i have now to , again , send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far , i am not holding my breath for answers . still want to buy a kodak ? go ahead but do n't say i did not warn you . by the way , my other camera is a casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not"

neg,"that this great music sounds so awful on this cd . i wanted an introduction to kate bush 's music , and this cd seemed a very good way to start . when i put it on , i could n't believe how muffled and dull it sounded . i could swear i 'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton . i went to the existing reviews here on amazon , and , sure enough , ferrara brain pan 's spot-on review stated exactly what i was feeling upon listening to these recordings . it is inexcusable that an artist of bush 's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame , considering how good the songs are . another little beef is that the cd clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words , there 's room for 30 more minutes of music , which i 'm certain could have been well-used , considering the vastness of her catalogue . i will be looking for the remastered individual albums , but if i did n't know how good kate bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection , i would n't bother buying any more of her material . shame on emi for allowing this . i give it two stars ( instead of one ) simply because the music is so very good"
pos,"i 'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard . i 'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i have to carefully prep for shaving . after years of trial and error , i 've finally settled on a good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser for a base , then kiss my face moisture shave as a supplement . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i use a product like clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver . with the gillette fusion power , i 've finally found the right one . i 've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first gulf war ( i was in the marines at the time ) . they 've gotten the job done , but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type . it does n't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck , especially since i take forever to change blades . i dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots ( not to mention getting blood stains on my collar ) . electric shavers do n't work for me either - too hard on my skin , and i 'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it a shot . i was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers . but the fusion power is the happy exception . at first i struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end . but once i mastered that maneuver and got the battery in , i was set . it takes one aaa-battery that seems to last a decent interval ( the low-battery indicator is a nice touch ) . and even if the fusion power runs out of juice , you can still shave with it . the shaver glides over my face , and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning . the five blades really nail my beard , and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free . i also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue is the expense of the blades . but i can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave . and most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i do , it 's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , the result is worth the higher price . the gillette fusion power is the best shaver i 've ever tried . highly recommended"

pos,"2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that does n't require you to have seen the original . i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out , and having never seen the original , i thought i would be lost and would n't enjoy myself as much as other people , but on the contrary - i left the experience much happier than when i came in . this film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh . the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open . i have heard and read that people did n't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races , but overall , i think the balance works well . even thinking of the plot that we are left with , i really ca n't see another time when a race would even be appropriate . and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original , i would have to disagree...why ? frankly , i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor . ( i mean , c'mon - have you seen the pacifier ? ) he 's nothing more than a meat head who , while able to do pretty good fight scenes , should leave the dialogue to someone else . yes , this film is for the younger crowd , and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take the boat jumping as an example ) , but there is no saying that an older person would n't enjoy it as well...the only thing that i will say is that you really should n't go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance , or else you will be disappointed . if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is , however , you will thoroughly enjoy yourself"

neg,"if you want my review in a nutshell , here it is : two defective rise & shine lamps . one call to verilux . verilux refuses to help . if you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass , read on . my verilux product experience : i exchanged my first verilux rise and shine natural alarm clock & bedside lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker , ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping ( if i am to understand the verilux ' company president 's response to a similar defect report in these reviews ) . the good news : the speaker in the second unit now works . and contrary to some of the other reviewers i feel the mylar speaker sounds quite good - - although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice ( with a line-in jack for cd player or ipod ) . the bad : despite the jumbo lcd display that might lead you to assume that the am / fm tuner is digital , the radio is completely analog . the station ids are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead - - small enough that some owners will need their glasses and a magnifying glass to select a radio station . by contrast , i own an alarm clock by conair with a similar analog tuner , with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point lcd digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit lcd display . on verilux ' comparatively enormous lcd , i am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option . an analog tuner without a station display is something i expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock , but not from a product of this type , which is otherwise very well thought out . unfortunately , due to an apparent flaw in the shade and / or the lamp itself , the shade on my replacement lamp - - the lamp i received from the store in exchange - - wo n't sit straight ! one can remove the shade , look at the lamp on a level surface , and see the lamp "" shelf "" slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted ! making the situation worse , the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered . there are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down ( as typical of most lampshades ) . the ring , in turn , sits on the lamp body ( or shelf ) . the whole assembly is cockeyed , including the socket into which the bulb sets ( at a very obvious angle ) ! cosmetically speaking , there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type . whereas the first lamp i purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the lcd panel , the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf , and it , too , must have been obtained in manufacturing . as for the shade itself , it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish , roughly 3 / 4 "" , that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen . so while the second lamp did not have a doa speaker , i apparently traded one problem in for another . worse , the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room ( and would probably appear that way from down the street if i were to set it on the curb ) . in short , the verilux rise & shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price / warranty suggests . and in case you are wondering if this might have been "" gray market "" merchandise , it wasn't . i purchased my rise & shine lamp straight out of a high-end , authorized retail store , new-in-box . the am / fm clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light , finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds - - contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5 "" wide at the base and 20 "" tall - - makes for an outstanding combination and concept . for this reason , i hope verilux will continue to refine the rise and shine model , particularly where quality control is concerned . given that i am a gadget fan , and someone who has rated products 1 / 5th the price of this lamp very highly , it should be understood that i really wanted to give this a positive review . but two duds in a row ? irony the rise & shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer . given that my replacement lamp is also defective , i followed these instructions . but in reality , verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers ' problem , not theirs ( as per the instruction i received to make a third 40-mile trip back to the store where i purchased it ) . conclusion ? verilux does n't back their warranty ( in my experience / opinion ) . nor , apparently , does verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers . so if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong , consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience . and believe me , there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of verilux ' customer service department , either . what verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the internet . as it so happens , i supplement my income writing product reviews for websites . in fact , i am a writer by training / trade . translation : verilux chose the wrong customer to let down . i have no intention of smearing verilux ' reputation - - unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such . would i recommend this product to a friend ? yesterday i might have said yes , chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke . today , coupled with the fact that verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy , my answer is a resounding no . should anyone at verilux read my review , i wish to close with this thought : i could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems i noted , but a ~$5 lampshade , to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box - - and does n't sit straight , to boot - - is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy ?"

pos,"unfortunately , millions of americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress , anxiety , and depression . in the pharmaceutical industry , anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market . the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear , and reasonably so . in recent years , taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin . however , the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently . in the past year , some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light , much to the horror of patients and physicians alike . anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction , severe withdrawal , weight gain , vertigo , and even suicide and death . to treat the symptoms of stress , anxiety , and depression , without negative health implications , many are now turning to natural supplements - - safely and with much success . most consumers are confused about which natural stress , anxiety , and depression supplements to take . fortunately , there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results , safely . the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one 's that are based more on marketing hype . it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study , and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product . this is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress , anxiety , and depression . after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective . there are a few , however , with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses . these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress , anxiety , and depression . after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended , here is a list of the top the top 10 stress , anxiety and depression supplements on the market today : 1 ) anxietol 7 ( tm ) 2 ) welatonin ( tm ) 3 ) pinadol ( tm ) 4 ) seredyn ( tm ) 5 ) prosera ( tm ) 6 ) amoryn ( tm ) 7 ) euphorx ( tm ) 8 ) herbval supra ( tm ) 9 ) clarocet-nri ( tm ) 10 ) relora ( tm )"
pos,i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience . i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity . it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems . i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary . it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything .

pos,"what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style . he is careful not to over do it , while still demonstrating skill and precision . his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed . the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs , i rarely make it to the end of this cd . still for those who enjoyed & quot ; a go-go&quot ; , this one is quite similar , so make sure to pick it up . this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking , but is a great casual listen .

pos,"i recently re-read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival 's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder . drawn from sir thomas north 's 1579 english version of plutarch 's lives , william shakespeare ( 1552-1616 ) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career , around 1607 , and published it in the first folio in 1623. it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers , roman military leader , marc antony , and the captivating queen of egypt ( and former mistress of julius caesar ) , cleopatra . when his wife , fulvia unexpectedly dies , antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister , octavia . of course , this news enrages passionate cleopatra . she vents her anger on the messenger , but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty . however , antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra 's arms , abandoning his new wife in athens . this leads to war , when octavius declares war on egypt . after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria , cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide , which prompts antony to wound himself mortally . antony dies in his lover 's arms , and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar ( octavius ) , the heart-broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs . in the end , antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes . it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next . g . merritt"

neg,"i was completely fooled . twice . my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas . so as i slowly open the box , i see a pair of socks on top . there was more underneath , so i start opening it further and there is a camera case , a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box , the hp photosmart m525 digital camera ! i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own . no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures . i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures . to put it bluntly , ugh ! ! ! the first thing that i noticed is that , even in best picture mode , the pictures were a little blurry / grainy even in the best of lighting conditions . the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted . there 's a slight fisheye effect ( imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door . ) which is quite annoying . i talked to hp support ( someone who spoke very poor english i might add . what is the deal with that ? ) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model . guess what ? same problem ! so after talking to hp once again , i am returning this one and getting a different brand . this is a horrible product . my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product . i am very disappointed . hp needs to put out a better product , and have some customer support reps that speak better english . it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood"

neg,"first , here are some general positives about jaci velasquez : - she is a very gifted singer . her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with mariah carey and christina aguilera . - she is beautiful . and unlike a previous reviewer , i do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty . i like beautiful singing voices . i like beautiful women . there 's no difference . - she has great spiritual depth . her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love , faith and joy . now , here 's a critique of the cd : i listened to all the music samples ( as you can do as well ) and only one song caught my attention - "" lay it down "" . the other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste . but the song "" lay it down "" was different . it sounded more acoustic , more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music . i found the sound clip of "" lay it down "" to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970 's - eric carmen 's "" all by myself "" , later covered by celine dion in 1996. "" all by myself "" is a ballad having a soft , understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus . the sample clip of "" lay it down "" appears to be in the same mold . it has a soft , understated introductory verse ; however , it seems to lack an explosive chorus . listen to the sample and hear it for yourself . the introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics : "" all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans are slowly slipping through my folded hands "" so far , so good . there 's only a piano and a violin accompanying jaci 's soft vocals . next , the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics : "" so i 'm gonna lay it down i 'm gonna learn to trust you now "" now here 's a problem . i am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of jaci velasquez to showcase her voice . but it is not forthcoming . why ? this intrigued me and i wanted to hear the whole song but i did not want to purchase a cd for only one song . luckily , i discovered that a compilation cd of jaci velasquez 's best songs was released recently and it contained "" lay it down "" . great ! i bought the cd - "" on my knees : the best of jaci velasquez "" . this is what i discovered after listening to "" lay it down "" . - the first time through the verse and the chorus , the song is definitely understated . we simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with jaci 's soft vocals . - the second time through the verse and the chorus , a drum beat is introduced and jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs . but somewhat to my dismay , this is not the same voice that i am expecting from jaci velasquez . her voice was more raspy and raw ( actually , it was sounding more like demi moore or tara reid , not that that is necessarily bad ) . furthermore , she appeared to be struggling . is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as "" on my knees "" , "" speak for me "" , and "" adore "" ? is jaci velasquez losing her voice ? i do n't know but i find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20 's is losing her voice . she is entering her prime . barring a health issue , this just does n't happen . "" lay it down "" is actually a pretty good song . in fact , i am almost of the opinion that it may be her best . i certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others . "" lay it down "" has the same message as the beatles ' classic "" let it be "" . the words are different but both songs share the same sentiment . actually , now that i think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words "" let it be "" . here are the closing lyrics : "" i 'm gonna let it be , i 'm gonna let it go i 'm gonna lay it down "" the essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "" let go and let god "" - a profound spiritual insight . something that each of us here is learning . this song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching . and though her voice is struggling through it , the song , nevertheless , works out its magic . i gave this cd 2 stars because i think jaci velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded . interestingly enough , her best sound was her first cd - un lugar celestial ( a heavenly place ) . bring back the spanish / flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound . in my opinion , the acoustic sound is more spiritual . keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects . develop a latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz . hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player . emphasize ballads . that should do the trick"
pos,"bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era . but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we 'd least like to go - - inside ourselves . i found this an incredibly powerful book . i 've used sections of it with my "" change management "" classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students , who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy . if you want a simple formula for change , do n't buy this book . although it is full of practical , actionable ideas , "" change the world "" addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for . it 's a very difficult but rewarding assignment"

pos,"i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the "" drink me "" bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films"
pos,"a film that 's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism . since nothing is as it seems , we may as well be inside a fictionalized world ; like the unicorn story the main character , cathryn , is writing . this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding , is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination ; however , the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring . a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem ( hugh is played by rene , rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh . cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn ) . insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind , but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside . a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action , another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance"
neg,"i remember this album well ; you could hardly call it a ' barnstormer ' , as it was released well before "" under the bridge "" made them the bandwagon band of the year , but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right- -they never had a good album . for every song worth listening to ( "" suck my kiss "" , "" give it away "" ) , there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded . this album was and remains a perfect example of why bands should n't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can . on top of that , the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief . some friends and i got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album , and kiedis was so off-key , it was n't funny . they drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals , but the damage was done . people were walking out in droves"

neg,""" the door in the floor "" is difficult to like , even , ( or perhaps especially ) , if you 're a fan of john irving 's book , "" a widow for one year , "" which was the source of this film . the movie is dark , depressing , & slow-moving . it also showcases the least likable characters from the book . to make matters worse , it focuses only on the first third of the novel 's story , which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated , ( & alienating ) , couple 's suffering . the film is completely devoid of the novel 's interesting & more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family 's life & into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who are n't well developed in the film , but who are central to the book 's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story ! this may give you an idea why the film was n't very successful with audiences . the theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people . unfortunately , the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents , played by jeff bridges & kim basinger , in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons . it wallows in the empty chasm that 's grown between them & delves into the sad , meaningless , & even cruel love affairs they each engage in , in vain attempts to ease their sorrows & escape the pain of the love lost between them & of course , the greatest loss , the loss of their sons . the film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose . and finally , we witness the pain of their very young daughter , who was born out of yet more of the parent 's attempts to fill their empty , sad lives , and we 're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood , growing up with parents who truly "" are n't there . "" the greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel , and even worse , why they chose to "" bring to life "" only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it ! if the theme of loss is one you 're very interested in , you might find this movie quite affecting . as for me , a great fan of the book , i can only hope that someday someone makes a better & more complete adaptation of this great book . it 's not nearly as desperate & sad a story as this film version ! on subsequent viewings i 've grown to appreciate this film a bit more . taken completely apart from the novel , it 's not a "" bad "" film . undoubtedly , the performances are wonderful , however little fun they are to watch ."

neg,"yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put , but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author does n't know how to write . my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author 's alternative grammatical rules . comma splices and run-on sentences are not , and never will be , acceptable to me . occasional use can be overlooked , but shaara peppers every page with them , tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject . the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading . the following example is made-up , but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes : "" he turned in the saddle , rode toward his headquarters over the ridge , refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance , focused instead on the day ahead , forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand . "" one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this . the result is a book that reads like a rough draft , or maybe not even that ; it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft . i do n't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work , and i do n't understand why readers put up with it . another problem is the lack of convincing characterization . everyone is vaguely noble here , with the exception of a few complete cads . washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home . cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home . greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home . i think you get the picture . few characters stand out on their own . even lafayette is just another young officer . the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book . and shaara 's attempts at making his characters witty never work . the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull . beyond that , i 'm doubtful about the author 's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter . it 's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin 's mind . but the rest of the time , it does n't work well . i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus . either i 'm a lazy reader ( and i 'm not ) , or the device is n't working well . in addition , this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france , and washington , green , cornwallis and howe in america . that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england , and the continental congress in america . in effect , this novel is really about washington 's military camp and howe 's dinner table , which makes the narrative unbalanced . some aspects of the story are interesting . i enjoy reading about washington 's maneuvers , and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him . i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were , and when . but i wish now that i 'd just bought a decent beginner 's history on the war . most of the book , as literary fiction , left me cold"

pos,"the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson 's third major motion picture . the movie revolves around a rich , but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum ( gene hackman ) . royal and his wife etheline ( angelica huston ) had three children : chas ( ben stiller ) , margot ( gwyneth paltrow ) , and richie ( luke wilson ) . in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america 's premier families : margot was a famous playwright , richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u.s. nationals , and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen . that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten . betrayal , failure , and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died . what 's worse is that royal 's children and wife blame him for all their failures . royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right . with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend , pagoda ( kumar pallana ) , royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family 's eyes . i 'm a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films . the royal tenenbaums is anderson 's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture . however , it is my least favorite of his movies . like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue . the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family , a theme that i enjoy . yet , the film just did n't resonate with me as much as anderson 's other pictures . i really do n't know why that is . that 's not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it 's not . in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting , brilliant set designs , etc. i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead"

neg,"received the dxg-506v yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount . many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam . this is kind of like false advertising . this is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices ( like the optimus that radio shack sells ) and there is also no image stabilization . geez , how hard would it have been to put a simple ¼ inch plastic mount on the bottom . as for sound , the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting . you can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting . that is pretty bad . the resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970 's cassette tape recorder . the best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in avi , mov or asx format at different resolutions which is why i got it in the first place . it is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical . it also has a lens cap . my advice to dxg is this . 1. add a tripod mount . 2. move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that i can use an external microphone . that would be sweet . 3. improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations . the optional settings do nothing to improve this . i tried them all . bottom line is that i would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount . there are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use ."

pos,"i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f / 4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 / f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs / 1 , 470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft / 1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod / monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m / 4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m / 8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f / 2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses"

pos,"unlike most dystopian novels , which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future , "" a clockwork orange "" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future . our protagonist is alex , only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal , roving the streets with his band of friends , taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him . the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless . in fact , the more helpless the victim , it seems , the more pleasure the boys take in the act . the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes . they are n't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets ; in fact , it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim . they are creating mayhem just because it 's fun for them . everything changes , however , when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder . there , though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior , we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality . then , after two years , he is chosen for a new , experimental rehabilitation program , designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in , or even contemplate , any acts of violence . as we see , however , this "" treatment "" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not . he has to be good because he is programmed to be . this , of course , raises the question central to the book : does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice ? the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first , predominantly because of burgess 's unique style . the story is narrated by alex and thus , is written in the complex slang language , invented by burgess for this book , that the youth of this society engage in . for example , a sentence taken from the opening chapter : "" he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that "" ( pg . 5 ) . there is no glossary , but if you stick with it , you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters . however , if you find yourself having difficulty , a nice , comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for "" english to nadsat "" ( due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link ) . unfortunately , it is alphabetized by the english equivalents , not by the slang terms , so looking up a word can be a little difficult . one final note of interest : the original british publication of "" a clockwork orange "" had 21 chapters , as does the current american edition . however , when the book was first published in the united states , the last chapter was dropped . as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version , publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout . whether it is or is n't is up to you to decide , but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book . without the final part of the story in place , the book offers a bleak message , implying that human nature cannot really change . on the other hand , reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope . beyond that , burgess tells us in his introduction , interpretation is up to you"

neg,"mark twain once said that ( and i paraphrase ) the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read . that is my experience with this book . for some reason , a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists , and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt . so i picked it up . what a slog ! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama . we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton , a character who you barely get to know , and root for lucie manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness . the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge . an admittedly cool concept . maybe this book speaks to another era , maybe it 's past its prime , maybe i do n't have the required literary sensibilities , or maybe i could n't relate , but a tale of two cities bored me to tears ."

neg,"this could have been an excellent documentary , but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly . this is particularly true in the way it depicts sparta as being some kind of womyn 's power state which is absurd . somewhat comically , the narrator enhances the story of sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus . she tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality . hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "" feminist wonderland , "" but that 's exactly what is implied . i do n't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as : "" fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother . "" yeah right ! unless of course , husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal . pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful . to many counter-culturalists , history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program . unfortunately , that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work . as for bettany hughes , i agree that she is quite attractive , but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy . hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing sparta- -i 'll take victor davis hanson any day over her . i recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians ."

( he did n't know about the microdermabrasion . ) and even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty . there was a clear and noticeable difference- -after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow , and the few large pores i have did appear smaller . being lazy , i have not incorporated it into my regular routine like i should , but i do pull it out a few days before special occasions , vacations , or anytime i feel the need for a little brightening up , and will definitely always keep it on hand . if you have particularly sensitive skin , this may not be a great product for you , as it is a bit , well , abrasive . for me , it was a painless process , and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow"

neg,"this is a rather peculiar film for seagal , and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film . seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief . in fact , they are extraordinarily brief , though thankfully free of wirefu . though out of reach is by no means a total failure ( it 's actually pretty entertaining , seagal as always is fun to watch , and some of the scenes are well done ) , the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes . this film is a drama about a nature nut ( seagal ) who roams the forest looking for injured animals . he has a pen pal in poland , a young girl , and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her , even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her . this brings up the main problem with this film , namely , a lot of it simply does n't make any sense . it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring , and seagal goes through the motions to save her . as per usual with seagal nowadays , he obviously refused to actually finish the production , and so we have the usual dubbing problem here . it is even more salient than usual in this picture , however , for here we have not one , but several different people dubbing seagal 's voice , none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him ! here the most frequently heard fill-in for seagal sounds like a knock-off benecio del toro with a much higher-pitched voice . as you can imagine , the effect is very humorous . as stated above , the main problem with this movie is that it simply does n't make sense , which was apparently realized by the director , as he has , in many scenes , the voice fill-in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking ! how obnoxious ! seagal 's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal , which she later uses to communicate with seagal . what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal , the villian , ineptly played by matt schultz , sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find ! in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code . ( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "" this is a trap . "" ) the villain sees her doing this , and , instead of destroying the message ( which would make sense ) , later has it delivered to seagal ! huh ? in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is , the villian sees her doing it , comments on how clever she is , but then leaves the message ! there are also quite of few mistakes in this film , several of which are laughably obvious . at the beginning and end of this film , for example , seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy , black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head . during the rest of the film , however , he has short hair . at the end , after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly , each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz 's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock , and even though in the very next closeup seagal 's pistol is still cocked ! after a sword fight , which ends on a classic move from older chambara films , notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor , and that then , all-of-a-sudden , there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters . in the finale , the above-mentioned sword fight , the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal . this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans : his overuse of stunt doubles . it 's almost so bad now that one could say that he does n't even film his own fight scenes now . have you ever noticed that in lord steven 's early films , when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves ? now what happens ? the camera gets as close as possible , shows some shots of his face grunting , shows some arms playing paddycake , then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal 's face . ever wonder why ? it 's because , surprise , surprise , that 's not seagal doing the fighting . in the gun fight , which is actually a very decent action scene , watch seagal as he enters the room . his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll , which is probably the simplest move in aikido , though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll . what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film , which shows seagal 's character "" roaming the forest looking for injured animals , "" or whatever , it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest . was he afraid that he 'd trip over a branch and injure himself ? was he afraid he 'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods ? i do n't know . what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact , using another actor , in order to make the film work . i 'm really not bashing seagal , i 'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed . be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office . the postal worker calls seagal "" mr. delacraw , "" or some such bizarre name , even though his character 's name is actually billy ray lancing . seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man , and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent . this scene is downright strange . what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene- -like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan , vampire wannabe in a strange , black fur coat . i do n't know , at least it 's good for a laugh . if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable . the only truly schocking thing is that this has n't happened yet . he shows up late to shoots , leaves early , refuses to finish productions , and yet people keep hiring the man . he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production . he needs to start finishing his films . in closing , out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes , but they are somewhat well done . seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight , which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human ."

neg,"so this was my first digital camera , got it last july for my birthday . i go to a lot of concerts , so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on , it went back to normal . alarmed , i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again . it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again . but that was only one thing wrong with it . this is a horrible camera for concerts , the pictures are always blurry . shoot , even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went to see my fav band again , and the dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off and on again . now the flash is broke and i 'm ready to throw it against the wall . you ca n't trust this camera . you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute !"

pos,"i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something that really , really works well , in a highly flexible and controllable way ! what a relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , and other packages i have tried and reviewed . the key capability lies in the "" save as "" command , which includes "" optimized pdf "" as one of the file types . the "" settings "" there gives you the power to choose jbig2 and jpeg2000 compression , the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers . and of course , as pdf , they are easy for anyone to read . an example : two weeks ago , the world 's top empirical nuclear physicist , in japan , sent me a set of 24 1-meg jpegs for a 24-page paper . nothing i had would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix the pages and crop them ; in adobe 6.0 , they ended up being a readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out at work , and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier / scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( the copier was modern and "" intelligent "" . ) then , at home , in adobe 6 , it would optimize it to pdf version 6 , a nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got it to 940 k ( and better quality , to the eye ) in acrobat 8.0 , in a controllable predictable way . i had previously tried many , many other options ( including lots of microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i have seen.. . i could have used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all that printout and scan nonsense ! the direct control in the "" save as "" command gets rid of the need to do all that . what 's more , i just reduced a 3.5 meg file ( from the best previous material ) to 1.02 megs . ( as best i recall , i used cvision before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better . ) if you google a lot on compression and comparisons , you will see some small advantage of cvision over older versions of adobe image capture and acrobat . but that 's misleading . in acrobat 6.0 , i could n't get to that better compression . ( maybe if i had a phd in adobe , i could , but i tried hard. . ) . with 8.0 , it was easy . and the results are better than cvision now , so far as i can tell . i certainly see no value at all in the new xps formats microsoft is touting , with vista , now that something so much better is available . one caveat : published benchmarks say that the djvu format may be better yet . i did not consider it , partly because of cost , but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going to my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again.. . knowing what lies behind djvu. . we might figure out something even better.. . eventually.. . and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that !"
